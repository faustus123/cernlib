This PAM consists of a set of utility routines and programs for
client-server computing.
 
The following people have contributed to this PAM:
 
          Rene Brun          Tony Cass          Olivier Couet
          Frederic Hemmer    Burkhard Holl      Catherine Magnin
          Ignacio Reguero    Fons Rademakers    Ben Segal
          Jamie Shiers       Jonathan Wood/RAL  Thomas Schwab/GSI
 
================================================================================
 
N.B. on LINUX,  cc -Dlinux_softland for the 'Softland' dialect
        -----   of linux
 
N.B. on IBMVM,  +USE,TCPSOCK,T=INHIBIT. to activate PASCAL version of TCPAW.
        -----   The C version, which is the default, requires TCP/IP V2 or
                higher, plus IBM SAA C compiler
 
                Use EDCLIB MACLIB for assembler routines activated by TCPSOCK.
 
N.B. on Apollo, TCPAW must be compiled under BSD:
        ------
 
ver bsd4.3
cc -c tcpaw.c
 
     on SGI, add -lsun
        ---
 
N.B. on VAX/VMS systems, netreq, serror, socket must be compiled:
        -------
 
cc /DEFINE=TGV for systems running Multinet   TCP/IP
cc /DEFINE=TWG for systems running Wollongong TCP/IP
 
SYSREQ is not currently supported for other VAX/VMS TCP/IP versions,
notably DEC/UCX.
 
$if f$trnlnm("MULTINET")   .nes. "" then write sys$output "Multinet TCP/IP"
$if f$trnlnm("TWG$ETC")    .nes. "" then write sys$output "Wollongong TCP/IP"
$if f$trnlnm("UCX$DEVICE") .nes. "" then write sys$output "UCX TCP/IP"
 
 
N.B. on AIX systems, add the following line to /etc/environments:
        ---
 
xrf_messages=no
 
This turns off the printing of FORTRAN error messages, which disturb
the protocol used between ZFTP & ZSERV.
