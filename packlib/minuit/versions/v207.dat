C- Introduce the following decks:
C     MNPARS   new routine, user-callable, to define a parameter
C                  specified only by a character-string
C     MNINPU   new routine, user-callable, to change input unit
C     MNCOMD   new routine, user-callable, to execute a command
C                  specified only by a character-string
C- Major changes in:
C     MNREAD   which now calls MNPARS instead of MNPARM (then
C                  MNPARS calls MNPARM, so where is the big deal?)
C- Small but important changes in:
C     MNCROS  to keep points inside limits in ALL cases.
C     MNMNOT  to keep points inside limits in ALL cases.
C     MNCONT  to get the error flag right
C     all routines using ISW(6) which can now take on values 1,0,-1
C- Very Minor changes in many routines
