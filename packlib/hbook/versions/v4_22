*-- Author :    Rene Brun   30/03/94
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/14   14/10/94 12.20.44
*
*    Due to some early design mistake PAW expects all character columns to
*    be returned in character*32 variables instead of in variables of the
*    original size. For single character variables this was fine, however
*    character array columns were not restored correctly (unless they had
*    an original size of 32). To fix this HBOOK has to know if the Ntuple
*    is read back by PAW. Bit 3 in the status word of the first block is
*    set in this case (in HBNAM). HGNT2 and HGNTF check this bit in case
*    of character arrays. Routines modified: HBNAM, HGNT2, HGNTF, HNTGET,
*    HRIN.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/13   28/09/94 08.40.30
*
*    Change in HBUG. When LERR.LE.0 error messagse are not printed.
*
*    HNTDEL: fix UHTOC call (don't multiply NCHRZ by 4).
*
*    Change default quota to 32000 records in HRFILE
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/12   19/09/94 11.16.36
*
*    Move VIDQQ sattement in HLIMAP to avoid problem with F2C.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/11   05/09/94 13.36.29
*
*    Many decks indented.
*
*    New option in HLIMAP.
*    When the first parameter LIMIT=0, an existing shared memory
*    is attached as the current directory. In this case, HLIMIT must have been
*    called before.
*
*    Changes in HDIFF to solve numerical problems (precision).
*
*    Extend range of formats in HINDEX and HINPRX.
*
*    Bug corrected in HRESETM1 and HREZ0M in case of profile histograms
*    or histograms with error bars (bug reported by W.Brueckner)
*
*    Protection in HFCXY for large real numbers
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/10   04/08/94 14.58.02
*
*    Routine HALLOC:
*    Free all Ntuple buffers or all buffers belonging to Ntuples in
*    the same unit.
*    If lun<0 free all Ntuple buffers that are in use (do this from an
*    exception handler in case the filling of the buffers was
*    interrupted).
*
*    Modification in HREBIN. If IFIRST<0 then do not normalize Y values
*
*    Bug corrected in HMINUT when option 'E' is specified.
*      NARGS must be set to 0 before calling MNEXCM in this case.
*      (Problem reported by Marcos Dracos)
*
*    Profile histograms can be filled with weights (mods in HFILPF)
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/09   27/07/94 18.45.44
*
*    Implement calculation of errors in HOPERA for 2-D histograms
*
*    Deck HALLOC: force refill of Ntuple cache also when event range changes.
*                 added new routine HBFREEC to free cache associated
*                 with chains.
*
*    Routine HBALLOC: pass also first event (to define event range).
*
*    Routine HGNT1: accepts dynamic buffer offsets as argument (used by
*    HGNTBF).
*
*    Routines HGNT, HGNTV, HGNTB: changed call to HGNT1 accordingly.
*
*    Routine HGNT2: check for the usage of the cache for each variable
*    instead of only once.
*
*    Routine HGNTBF: completely re-written. Does not read a whole column
*    in cache anymore. Is now a convenient front-end for HGNT2 with the
*    IVOFF cache offsets set.
*
*    New routine HCPOFF: copy cache offsets into an array IVOFF. This array
*    is used in case of chains in PAW to continue filling the cache in the
*    place where the last call to HGNTF stoped.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/08   15/07/94 09.31.43
*
*    Modify calling sequence of HNTDUP (new convention for NEWBUF)
*
*    New routine HBGMAX in HALLOC to return the maximum amount of memory
*    that may be malloced.
*
*    Protection in HSCR in file in READ only mode
*
*    New routine HCONVOL introduced (Per Steinar Iversen)
*    See comments in routine
*
*    Modify dummy calls to HFUNC,HSUPIM,HSUPIS to avoid intercompilation
*    analysis message on Alpha/VMS.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/07   28/06/94 17.44.26
*
*    New routine HMERGE(Nfiles,Files,Filout)
*    New Routine HMERGIN calls HMERGE
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/06   28/06/94 08.25.18
*
*    Mods in HRFILE to take into account possible new option 'N' in RZMAKE
*
*    HRESET can reset ntuples
*    New routine HNTRSET called by HRESET for CWNtuples
*
*    Implement new option 'K' in HMINUT
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/05   21/06/94 18.38.39
*
*    Deck HALLOC: fix in case malloc and realloc fail.
*
*    Routine HMERGE: need option X in HROPEN for auto-record length
*    detection to work on Alpha/OSF/VMS.
*
*    Routine HNTDUP: updated some comments.
*
*    Mods in HMINUT.
*    Set the FNIX and FEPS parameters in agreement with the MINUIT definition.
*    Defaults are unchanged. FNIX and FEPS can be modified via
*    the routine HSETPR or PAW command HSETPR.
*
*    New routine HBAR2 to store errors for 2-D histograms
*    Routines HF2,HPAKE,HUNPKE,HFITH1 modified in consequence
*
*    hfithc - protection against deviation being 0 is introduced
*
*    hminut - correction MINUIT save file ISAV=7
*
*    Protection in HNTNAM in case of misalignement (INTEGER*4 mixed
*    with REAL*8 variables in the same block).
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/04   08/06/94 11.38.01
*
*    Routine HRENAME: works now also for CWN's.
*
*    Routine HBNT: in case of memory resident Ntuple set IQ(LCID+ZNCHRZ)=0.
*
*    Routine HUWFUN: cosmetic change.
*
*    New routine HNTDUP: duplicates a complete Ntuple header. Works for
*    CWN's as well as RWN's.
*
*    New routine HNTVDEF: returns a complete variable definition. Used
*    by HNTDUP (works for CWN's and RWN's).
*
*    New patch HMERGE: this patch contains the program HMERG that can merge
*    hbook files with identical objects. Histograms are added and
*    Ntuples are combined. Works for CWN's and RWN's.
*    HMERG is the main program (to be selected with option MAIN). It calls
*    the main control routine HMERGE (user callable).
*
*    Implement proposal from Stephane Coutu for the computation of errors
*    for profile histograms (see routine HBPROF)
*
*    Add TYPE declaration to several sequences
*
*    Changes in HIDOPT for option SHOW
*       Options PROS or PROE are displayed with option SHOW
*
*    Mods in HCX for the computation of errors for profile histograms.
*    With the previous versions, channels with one entry only had
*    an error=0. Now the error is teh sqrt(abs(content)).
*
*    Mystyping in HWPDCL  (PAWR8 instead of PAWCR8
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/03   30/05/94 14.10.33
*
*    Routine HLNEXT supports RLOGIN directories
*
*    New routine HRENAME(ID,CHOLD,CHNEW) to rename columns of ntuples
*
*    Bug fixed in HCDIR in case of subdirectories (hrout, option T, then HREND)
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/02   19/05/94 12.07.56
*
*    Several changes in patch HMCSTAT (Christine Beeston)
*    >1) I've fixed the bug with the number of entries - I now use HSUM instead
*    >of HNOENT to get the number of entries in a histogram, since including
*    >the underflows and overflows messes up the normalisation of the result.
*    >
*    >2) The user can now do multiple simultaneous fits (this was requested and
*    >seems useful) - to do this they must call HMCINI once for each set of
*    >histograms (each fit will have a data histogram and a set of monte carlo
*    >and weight histograms), and then
*    >HMCLNL must be called with the histogram identifiers and number of MC
*    >sources, as well as the fractions.
*    >
*    >HMCMLL already uses the new HMCLNL, I have left the old HMCLNL as HMCLNO,
*    >but will delete it in a couple of months.
*    >
*    >HMCINI and the new and old versions of HMCLNL both contain a banner
*    >announcing the change, as it's not backwards compatible.
*    >
*    >The weight histograms may be used for more than one of the
*    >fits if necessary - a check is made to make sure that they are not
*    >normalised more than once.
*
*    Minor change in HRENDC (nchmax=nchtop before loop)
*
*    Mods in HMINUT to compute an equivalent chisquare in case
*    of a log-likelihood fit
*
*    Bug fixed in HPAK in case weights <1.e-5 (number of entries was wrong)
*
*    Protection in HREND (NCHTOP was changed in the loop)
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/01   07/04/94 09.04.32
*
*    Bug corrected in HFC1 in case of empty histograms with one bin only
*
*::>          VERSION  4.22/00   30/03/94 09.53.07
*
*    Bug fixed in HBOOKN (IQ(LCIDN+5) set to ID) for disk-resident tuples
*    This bug affected HBOOK jobs calling HPROJ1,HPROJ2, HGN or HGNF when
*    the ntuple header was not written to the file
