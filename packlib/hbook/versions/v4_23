*
*    New user routines HIJE and HXYE for returning errors on cells in
*    2D histograms a la HIE,HXE.
*
*    New routine HBVERS in the C patch, that returns the version string.
*
*    Some error checking and extra calls to HBUG in the HFNT tree.
*
*    Modification to HCX to fix a bug produced when the routine was
*    called with option 2 (get error) for a histogram without the
*    required bank.
*
*    Extra argument IOPT added to HCXY in order to allow the caller
*    to specify whether the contents (IOPT=1) or the error (IOPT=2)
*    on the given cell is returned.
*
*    Bug corrected in HROUT. Problem was appearing in case of many
*    subdirectories. Variable NLCDIR was not correctly set when returning
*    to the parent level.
*
*    Deck HNTDUP: declare IDUM to be REAL*8 to make it double-word aligned.
*
*    Introduce DOUBLE PRECISION in HCX for Profile histograms
*
*    Adjust HREBIN to allow for non-equiwidth bins.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.23/00   05/11/94 09.36.29
*
*    HLDIR with CHOPT='N' works now also for disk directories.
*
*    Protect HMINUT when option Z is given (LINEAR was set to zero)
*
*    Protection in HFN in case HGIVEN is called immediatly before.
*       LCONT pointer is now always recomputed.
*
*    Implement ../ style in HPATH.
