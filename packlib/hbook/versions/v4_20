*CMZ :  4.20/14 22/10/93  11.19.43  by  Rene Brun
*-- Author :    Rene Brun   21/06/93
*
*::>          VERSION  4.20/14   22/10/93 11.19.43
*
*    Remove IOFSET limitation in HRIN for ntuples
*
*::>          VERSION  4.20/13   21/10/93 15.10.39
*
*    Introduce WINNT flag in nearly all routines with the LINUX flag.
*
*    Large array T removed in HMCLNL (C.Beeston)
*
*::>          VERSION  4.20/12   18/10/93 17.48.08
*
*
*::>          VERSION  4.20/11   15/10/93 16.56.03
*
*
*     Routine HGNTBF: fixed bug in case an index variable fit in memory
*     while the variable depending on that index variable did not fit in
*     memory.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.20/10   13/10/93 18.01.16
*
*
*     Implement possibility to list/plot histograms in a subdirectory
*       of a shared memory section. Mods in HCOPYU and HPLISM.
*
*     Routine HMCMLL: put DATA statement after declarations.
*
*     Routine HCDIR: don't allow to CD to server connection point (like
*     cd //piaf1) this does not make sense plus it causes conflicts when
*     a chain is named piaf1.
*
*     Routine HNBUF: first word of contents back must be zeroed. Fixes bug
*     when filling different Ntuples with index variables in the same job.
*
*     KEEP,HCMPCM contained +SELFs: OK for CMZ not for Patchy.
*          New KEEPs,HCMPCM1 and 2.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.20/09   28/09/93 16.39.40
*
*
*     New PATCH,HMCSTAT from Christine Beeston, R.Barlow from OPAL.
*      Fits the given Monte Carlo distributions to the data distribution, using
*      a binned maximum likelihood fit which includes the effect of both data
*      and Monte Carlo statistics, and allows weights to be
*      provided for each Monte Carlo distribution.  The data and Monte Carlo
*      distributions must be presented in 1 dimensional histograms.
*      The best estimate of the fraction of each Monte
*      Carlo distribution present in the data distribution is returned, with an
*      error estimate where required.
*
*     Common /PAWIDN/ : X(512) changed to X(522)
*
*     New routines HPLISG,HPLISG1 in patch HGLOBAL.
*     Routine HLDIR modified to call new routine HPLISG (VAX only).
*     HPLISH can do a Histo/List in Global sections.
*
*     Replace line with TEST.GT.1.5 by TEST.GE.0. in HFCN
*
*::>          VERSION  4.20/08   12/09/93 18.57.43
*
*
*     Histogram directory bank LTAB created and MZPUSHed with 500 words
*        and links instead of 50. This speeds up considerably programs
*        using a large number of histograms.
*
*     New deck HRNGPF in patch HBOOK
*     New deck HNDESC in patch HNTUP
*     Corrections in CWN filling and GET routines for character type columns
*
*     Ulrich Mueller changes for IEEE computers in filling routines.
*     There is an unpleasant feature in HBOOK on computers with IEEE 754
*     floating point arithmetic (in our case on DECstations under Ultrix
*     4.3a, CERNLIB 93b or 93d).
*
*     Calculations on these machines can give as result Infinity or
*     Not-a-Number (NaN). If one tries to fill these numbers into histograms
*     (and this happens in real-world applications, especially during the
*     development phase of a program), some problems may arise:
*
*     1) Filling of +/- infinity as value. This case is handled properly by
*        the checks for over/underflow and the value is counted as such.
*
*     2) Filling of NaN as value. The over/underflow checks fail because
*        relations like .LT. or .GE. are always false if one of the operands
*        is NaN. Then the value is converted to a bin address, which is an
*        undefined integer and finally results in either a segmentation
*        fault or an overwriting of memory somewhere.
*
*        However, this could easily be fixed, for example in HF1 (the other
*        routines are analogous):
*
*           IF(X.LT.Q(LPRX+1))THEN
*              ICHAN=0
*           ELSEIF(.NOT.(X.LT.Q(LPRX+2)))THEN
*              ICHAN=IQ(LPRX)+1
*           ELSE
*              ... calculate bin address ...
*           ENDIF
*
*        By changing the overflow check from .GE. to .NOT. .LT. the NaN
*        value will be counted as overflow. Another approach would be a
*        separate check for NaN, something like
*           IF (.NOT. (X.LT.0. .OR. X.GE.0.))
*        together with an appropriate error message.
*     ====>      This changes has been made in all filling routines
*
*     3) Filling of Infinity or NaN as a weight. This is maybe the worst
*        case. The value is added to the bin, and this results in a crash
*        when the ZEBRA structure is written to a file, or in a crash of PAW
*        if one tries to plot the bad histogram.
*
*        I propose to add a check for the finiteness of the weight. On most
*        machines a (C-)function "finite" is available for that purpose.
*     =====> This suggested change is not yet implemented.
