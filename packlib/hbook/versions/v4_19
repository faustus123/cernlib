*-- Author :    Rene Brun   29/04/93
*
*::>          VERSION  4.19/05   08/06/93 12.17.57
*
*
*      Add new sequence /CZCBUF/IZCBUF
*      Changes in HMACHI,HRDIR and HLOGPF to use JUMPT2 to call CZGETC
*
*::>          VERSION  4.19/04   07/06/93 08.48.10
*
*
*      Changes in HLNEXT (implement client/server for PIAF)
*      Routine HCREATEM modified for SYSV systems (ICOMAD(1) set to 0)
*      HRECOV improved for CWN. Recovery time faster.
*      Problem fixed in handling of chains (1st event was missed occasionally)
*
*::>          VERSION  4.19/03   27/05/93 15.28.21
*
*      LINUX version introduced (from V.Balashov and A.Lomov)
*
*      Changes to HRECOV. New routines HRECO1 and HRECO2
*
*::>          VERSION  4.19/02   26/05/93 16.00.03
*
*
*      New routine HRECOV to recover ntuples missing the last header info.
*      HRECOV attempts to read the latest saved header. From the header
*      information, it looks at all ntuple extensions to reconstruct
*      the maximum number of blocks/events.
*      If successful, the new header is written to the file
*      Header of CWM Ntuple is written the first time a content buffer
*      is written. The header is written again whenever a column has
*      been added to the Ntuple. After every HFNT2 call that caused
*      buffers to be written the RZ directory structure is flushed to disk.
*      These intermediate Ntuple headers are used by the HRECOV routine.
*      They can be recognized by the fact that IQ(LCID+ZNOENT) = -1.
*
*      Protection added in HBFUN2 (for HRNDM2) (O.Perdereau)
*
*      Improvements to HQSIG1/2/3. (J.Allison)
*
*      Mods in HROPEN. An already open file in U mode cannot be attached
*      if another process is also attaching the file in U mode. RZEND now
*      called to delete the ZEBRA structure.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.19/01   11/05/93 15.19.34
*
*      New sequences $CZBUFF and $CZSOCK in HCDES
*      Changes in HCDIR, HRDIR and HLOGPF for the PIAF server case
*
*      Routine HFN saves now the ntuple header and calls RZSAVE everytime
*      the RZ buffer is written to the file. This changes enables recovery
*      in case the job writing the ntuple crashes before HROUT/HREND.
*
*      HRIN modified for the ADD option (IOFSET=99999)
*      A user reported a case where ID1+IOFSET=ID of an existing histogram.
*      When IOFSET=99999, the internal offset is now chosen to avoid a conflict.
*
*      Bug corrected in HXE for variable bin size histograms
*
*      Mods in Memory mapping routines HCREATEM and HALLOC
*
*::>          VERSION  4.19/00   930429  8.34
*
*      WARNING!!!. Patch HCDES split into individual sequences.
*
*      New sequences JBYT3,JBYT4 introduced for MSDOS.
*      New sequence HCRLF (Carriage Return, Line Feed).
*      Several routines modified to introduce the flags MSDOS,NDP and GNU.
*      In printing formats, several '1' replaced by CRLF from HCRLF.
*
*      Sequence $HCK modified. Parameters KBWIDX,KBWIDY deleted.
*      Parameters KMIN,KMAX renamed KMIN1 and KMIN2.
*      New Parameters KMIN2,KMAX2.
*      Logic to support HMINIM AND HMAXIM for 2-DIM implemented.
*      As a consequence the inverse of the binwidth is not stored
*      anymore in the LCID structure.
*      The position Q(LCID+KBWIDX) is now occupied by Q(LCID+KMIN2)
*      The position Q(LCID+KBWIDY) is now occupied by Q(LCID+KMAX2)
*      Routines HMAXIM/HMINIM modified.
*      All HBOOK/HPLOT routines dealing with the binwidth are changed.
*
*      Bug fixed in HMINUT. In case of loglikelihood fits, the
*      MINUIT ERRDEF was incorrectly set to 0.5
*
*      Sequence /HCFITD/ has been modified to FITPAD(24),FITFUN
*      When the option 'U' is given in the fit routines, the application
*      must store the value of the function in FITFUN (Double Precision).
*      By default, HFITGA,PO,EX use the 'U' option.
*
*      Change in routine HOPER1 to prevent INTEGER Overflows in HFCX.
*      Number of entries in LC3 set to -1
*
*      Logic to handle ntuple chains introduced.
*
*      Bug corrected in HRZFRA (VAX version only)
*
*      Changes in HBUG (CHMESS(1:1)=+ prints Warning instead of Error
*
*      KEEP,HCFITR modified (added IFYLOW,IFYUP, renamed IFXLOW,IFXUP)
*      Introduce subrange in Y in all fitting routines
*
*      HBFUN1: Change LCONT to LFUNC. LCONT recomputed if user function
*         calls HFIND.
*      HRZIN: Change LBANK-JBIAS to LBANK+JBIAS
*      New routines for chains
*      New option 'A' in HDIFFB
