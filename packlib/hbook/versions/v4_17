*
*      Nasty bug found in HNTWRT. When routine HCDIR is called,
*         then IDLAST is reset to 0. If HNTWRT was called again,
*         in the same call to HFNT, then IDRZ(1)=0 !
*
*      Bug fixed in HLABEL and HLPOS (found by M.Goossens).

*
*::>          VERSION  4.17/05   930124 13.19
*
*      Protections in HROPEN if filename already attached.

*      Bug fix in HRMDIR, HMDIR, HGN and HGNF.
*      Bug fix in HALLOC (wrong memory allocation when the new buffer
*         is bigger than the previous one for the same column)
*
*::>          VERSION  4.17/04   930120  8.10
*
*      The following problems fixed after the release:
*      Implement option 'O' in HRFILE to create old format files
*      Corresponding changes in HREND,HRIN,HRMDIR,HMDIR,HFN
*      Bug fixes when merging old-format with new-format ntuples
*      Bug fixed in HLABEL for 2-D case.
*      Bug fixed in HLNEXT,HLDIR2 to access the first key of a file.
*      Replace BIGP in HBOOKN by 1.E30 to avoid overflow on IBM.
*
*
*::>          VERSION  4.17/03   930115 17.09

*
*     New example HEXAM8 in patch,HEXAM
*     Example HEXAM6 modified.
*     New ZEBRA pointers LHFIT,LFUNC,LHFCO,LHFNA introduced in HCBOOK

*       Existing routine HDIFF moved to this patch from patch,HBOOK.
*
*     New Patch,HQUAD introduced (Author John Allison Manchester)

*     basis functions on 1- and 2-D histograms and ntuples with up to
*     NDMAX variables.
*
*::>          VERSION  4.17/00   920731 15.54
*
*
*     New PATCH,HNTUP introduced

*     See new HBOOK manual for a complete description of the new ntuples.
*     Sequences /HCBOOK/, /HCDIRE/ modified.
*     Same sequences used by HPLOT and PAW (must be recompiled).
*
*
*      Protection in HOPER1 (divide by 0) (D.Sanders)
*
*      Routine HFITHC modified. DOUBLE PRECISION added.
*      Option 'L' added in HFITHN
*
*      Changes in HPAK,HFCX,HFCXY to increment the number of entries
*        following the sum of the contents in case of integer contents

*
*               ! ! ! !  W A R N I N G  ! ! ! !
*
*      HBOOK/RZ file format is changed. New version of HBOOK can still read
*      old format files. The change consists in adding a new key.
*      KEY(1)=ID as in old format
*      KEY(2)=ntuple extension  number (0 for histograms)
*      The new array ICHTYP(20) in HCDIRE contains the type of HBOOK file.
*        ICHTYP(ICDIR)=1 for old format HBOOK files
*                     =5 for new files
*      The new HBOOK files are machine independent and can be transported
