*    system routines on the various platforms that identify the
*    IEEE NaNs (where appropriate), and classifies them in a general
*    way. The routines are called in HFILL, HFN and HFNT2 to check
*    user arguments, and warnings are issued where appropriate.
*
*    New routine HNFORM for assiting users in creating the character
*    string that describes CW nTuple variables that is used as an
*    argument to HBNAME or HBNAMC.
