*
*   Implement the new FIND mechanism (new behavior for command "HELP".
*   Behavior of "HELP" is kept in new command name "CHELP" (for
*   "Command Help").
*   This new HELP is connected to the new directive:
*   >Keyword
*   list-of-keywords
*   in the CDF.
*   e.g.
*   >Command PSVIEW
*   >Parameters
*   FNAME 'File name' C
*   >Keyword
*   PostScript
*   display viewer
*   >Guidance
*   ...
*   Notes:
*   1- This implies to install also the new CDF compiler (kuipc) and
*   the new kxterm.
*   2- I have (at the same time) implemented in kuipc the new CDF directive:
*   >Link
*   list-of-links
*   similar to >Keyword (same logic), for future development arround the
*   HTML links.
*
*   Bug correction: MAX_opt (for option-menu parameters) was not
*   tested (MKDCMP). Do other check on "MAX" definition ($MKDIMS).

* Do not exit on input of mulitnational characters; they are ignored now.
*
* Write error message on attempt to create a vector with more than 3d;
*  previously quietly a 3d vector was created.
*
* Command panels: give possibility to have all parameters input in a
* scrolled window. Add new resource "scrolledCmdPanel. In .Xdefaults:
*    *scrolledCmdPanel: auto    (default)
* or *scrolledCmdPanel: always
* or *scrolledCmdPanel: never
* "auto" means that the scrolled window is automatically created if the
* number of params. > 10 (otherwise fixed size area). "always" and "never"
* means, respectively, that the scrolled window  is always (or never) created.
*
* km_create_sctext (used for "HELP") : calculate height of the window, to
* avoid too big windows with small amount of text.
*
* new routine "CreateIconWidget" to avoid extern reference to "iconWidgetClass"
* which was causing problems on VMS (for user-defined panels, "view" option
* "by name and icon").
*
* KUXXT, ICONWIDGET : small corrections for DEC-CC.
*
* For panel definition: accept labels with blank inside and replace blanks
* by '0' for valid alias definition (new routine strblk0).
*
* Bug correction in panel: when a new button is filled (mouse button 2)
* or a button is erased (mouse button 3) then do it in all "views"
* and not only in the current one (km_panel_execute).
*
* KMUMEN : small correction for DEC-CC.
*
* Panels: "view" option "by name and icon" is implemented (ICONWIDGET)
