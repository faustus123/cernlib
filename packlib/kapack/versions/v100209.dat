*--        SUBROUTINE KAOPTN MODIFIED TO WRITE A MESSAGE IN THE
*--        TRANSACTION LOG WHEN CALLED WITH OPTION LUNLOG=0
*--        (THIS OPTION HAS THE EFFECT OF SWITCHING OFF THE LOG
*--        AND PRIOR TO THIS MODIFICATION THERE WAS NO INDICATION
*--        THAT THIS HAD OCCURRED).
*--        STATEMENT NUMBERS CHANGED IN SUBROUTINES KATST1 AND KATST2.

*--            FORMAT AS OTHER MESSAGES.  SUBROUTINE KAXMSG HAS BEEN
*--            MODIFIED TO SUPPORT THIS AND IS NOW AN INTERFACE TO A NEW
*--            SUBROUTINE KAXED WHICH PERFORMS THE MESSAGE EDITING FORMERLY
*--            PERFORMED BY KAXMSG.
*--        (7) INTERNAL CHARACTER REPRESENTATION CHANGED: NULL=0, BLANK=99
*--            SUBPROGRAMS AFFECTED: KAXCHA, KAXICH, KAXINR & COMMON KAX004.
*--        (8) FUNCTION KAXXNK SPLIT INTO TWO FUNCTIONS, KAXNAM AND KAXE2I.
*--        (9) FUNCTION KAXXKN MODIFIED SLIGHTLY AND RENAMED KAXI2E.

*--            WITH DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES).
*--        (3) KASEQ AND KASEQM MODIFIED TO DETECT CHANGE OF UNIT.
*--
*--          CHANGES FROM 1.03
*--      (1) PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TO REDUCE THE CPU TIME AND NUMBER
*--          OF I/O OPERATIONS IN APPLICATIONS WHICH MAKE MULTIPLE CALLS
*--          TO KAPACK WITH THE SAME UNIT NUMBER AND MAJOR NAME.
*--      (2) 'RETURN=YES' ENFORCED DURING KALIST PROCESSING.
*--      (3) FORMAT OF KALIST OUTPUT CHANGED.
*--      (4) CMS FLAG INTRODUCED TO CREATE KA-FILES WITH A BLOCK SIZE
*--          OF 4K BYTES UNDER THE IBM VM/CMS OPERATING SYSTEM.
*--      (5) TEST PROGRAM CHANGED TO RETRIEVE AND VERIFY THE RECORDS

*--      (8) BUG FIXED IN VAX VERSION IN PRINTING DATE AND TIME.
*--      (9) TO ENABLE FILE SHARING ON VAX, THE 'SHARED' KEYWORD HAS BEEN
*--          ADDED TO THE OPEN STATEMENT IN SUBROUTINE KAXOPN.
*--     (10) STATUS='UNKNOWN' EXPLICITLY SPECIFIED IN OPEN STATEMENTS TO
*--          ELIMINATE ERROR MESSAGE ON VAX.
*--     (11) INTERNAL CHARACTER REPRESENTATION CHANGED. SUBPROGRAMS
*--          AFFECTED: KAXC2I (FORMERLY KAXICH), KAXI2C (FORMERLY KAXCHA).
*--          KA-FILES WHICH WERE CREATED WITH EARLIER VERSIONS OF KAPACK
*--          CANNOT BE PROCESSED WITH VERSION 2 OR LATER VERSIONS AND
*--          ATTEMPTS TO DO SO WILL PROVOKE ERROR CRNKA246. IN ORDER TO
*--          CONTINUE USING THESE KA-FILES THEY MUST BE CONVERTED BY A
*--          CALL TO SUBROUTINE KA1TO2 WHICH HAS BEEN ADDED TO THIS PAM
*--          FILE. IN ORDER TO CONVERT A KA-FILE THE FOLLOWING STEPS
*--          SHOULD BE TAKEN:
*--             (1) USE SUBROUTINE KACOPY TO MAKE A BACKUP OR COPY OF
*--                 THE KA-FILE.
*--             (2) EXECUTE A PROGRAM WHICH CALLS KA1TO2 IN THE FOLLOWING
*--                 WAY:
*--                          CALL KA1TO2(LUN)
*--                 WHERE LUN IS AN INTEGER WHICH IDENTIFIES THE UNIT TO
*--                 WHICH THE ORIGINAL KA-FILE IS CONNECTED.
*--             (3) ENSURE THAT THE PROGRAM TERMINATES NORMALLY AND
*--                 PRODUCES THE MESSAGE CRNKA500.
*--             (4) IF SUBSEQUENT PROCESSING OF THE CONVERTED KA-FILE IS
*--                 SUCCESSFUL THE COPY MAY BE DELETED.
*--
*--          CHANGES FROM 2.00
*--      (1) ASSEMBLY VERSION OF KAXRCL MODIFIED FOR ASSEMBLY UNDER CMS.
*--      (2) THE PERCENTAGE BLOCK UTILIZATION IS INDICATED IN MESSAGE
*--          CRNKA240 ISSUED BY KAXOPN.
*--      (3) EXECUTION TERMINATES IF KAXOPN DETERMINES THAT MODIFY=YES
*--          HAS BEEN REQUESTED AND THE FREE SPACE IS BELOW A THRESHOLD.
*--      (4) KAMAKE MODIFIED TO WRITE A MINIMUM OF 3 BLOCKS FOR
*--          COMPATIBILITY WITH THE KAXOPN THRESHOLD CHECK.
*--      (5) KACOPY MODIFIED TO PREVENT COPYING TO AN OUTPUT FILE
*--          WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN OPENED AS A KA-FILE IN THE SAME JOB.
*--      (6) KACOPY MODIFIED TO ENABLE A KA-FILE TO BE EXPANDED.
*--      (7) SUBROUTINE KALEN INTRODUCED TO RETRIEVE THE LENGTH
*--          ATTRIBUTES OF A RECORD.
*--      (8) FUNCTION KAXLOC RENAMED KAXGET.
*--      (9) LOGICAL FUNCTIONS REPLACED BY SUBROUTINES WITH ALTERNATE
*--          RETURNS.
*--
*--           Changes from 2.01
*--      (1)  Internal restructuring for support of asynchronous concurrent
*--           access, (ACA).
*--      (2)  KAXOPN modified to use COMMON/KAX0B0/ in place of /KAX0A0/.
*--      (3)  Former contents of COMMON/KAX070/ merged with COMMON/KAX020/.
*--           COMMON/KAX070/ now used as a lock queue for ACA operations.
*--      (4)  KAXFBK and KAXGBK modified to avoid block contention with
*--           ACA subroutines.
*--      (5)  Some adjustable array declarators replaced by assumed-size
*--           array declarators to avoid an error on VAX for zero-length
*--           records.
*--      (6)  Patchy flag 'CERN' removed.
*--      (7)  New user-callable subroutines: KAFREE, KAHOLD, KARLSE,
*--           KASTOP
*--      (8)  New internal subroutines: KAXAGE, KAXJID, KAXOLK, KAXRLK,
*--           KAXTLK
*--      (9)  Test job modified to call KAFREE, KAHOLD and KASTOP.
*--      (10) Additional installation parameters checked by KAXINR.

C      (1)  Subroutine KAXFBK modified to eliminate optimization action
C           on local variables.
C      (2)  Buffer length increased to 1500 words in CMS version.
C      (3)  Bug corrected in KAXINI affecting the setting of the error
C           unit number (LUNERR).
C      (4)  Patchy flag 'APOLLO' added.
C      (5)  Code added to KAMAKE and KAXOPN to obtain the file name on
C           Apollo systems.
C      (6)  RETURN statements added to KAXE2I and KAXI2E to circumvent
C           a NORD compiler bug.
C      (7)  Error in setting the value of NBLKS corrected in KAXINI.
C      (8)  Messages CRNKA261 and CRNKA271 expanded.
C
C           CHANGES FROM 2.03
C      (1)  Maximum name length changed from 50 to 100 characters.
C      (2)  New user-callable subprograms:
C           KAPRE  - retrieve the record preceding the one specified
C           KAPREM - retrieve the major name preceding the one specified
C           KAPRIK - print the values of the keys in a locked KA-file
C      (3)  In the VAX version, the READONLY parameter is used when
C           opening a KA-FILE with MODIFY=NO in effect. If KAOPTN
C           is called with the MODIFY option for an open file, the
C           file is closed and re-opened accordingly.
C      (4)  Minor changes to messages CRNKA080, CRNKA123, CRNKA124,
C           CRNKA125, CRNKA132 and CRNKA133.
C
C           CHANGES FROM 2.04
C      (1)  Alternative calling sequence provided for KAMAKE:
C                     CALL KAMAKE(LUN,SIZE,0,IRC)
C           where SIZE is a real number which specifies the total
C           size of the KA-file in megabytes, (no overhead is added).
C      (2)  References to KAXC2I and KAXI2C replaced by inline code.
C
C           CHANGES FROM 2.05
C      (1)  Major name stack implemented to eliminate a search of
C           the major tree for the most recently used major names.
C      (2)  KAXADD modified to ensure that there are sufficient
C           free blocks before a new entry is added.
C      (3)  Code added to KACOPY to ensure that the final block of
C           the output file has been written correctly when mode>1.
C      (4)  Messages CRNKA181, CRNKA182, CRNKA191, CRNKA192,
C           CRNKA241, CRNKA242 modified.

C           process assembler source.
C
C           CHANGES FROM 2.06
C           Bug fixed in KAXFBK which caused 'CORRUPT KAFILE' abends in
C           rare cases (involving repeated updates of the same records).
C           Bug fixed in KACOPY giving spurious error message at end of copy.
C           Bug fixed in KAXMAJ when making subsequent calls with different
C           MAJOR name but the same MINOR name (through KASEQ).
C           Bug fixed in KASEQM when called from KAPRIK.
C           All these errors were introduced in version 2.06.
C
C           CHANGES FROM 2.07
C           Bug fixed in KAXDEL when called from KADEL which led to
C           deletion of wrong index record pointers in rare cases. The
C           minor records were still in the data but could not be found
C           other than by sequential reading. This was a very old bug.
C           Bug fixed in KAXMAJ when called from KADELM which caused
C           deletion of a previously referenced major name in rare cases.
C           This bug was introduced at version 2.06.
C
C           CHANGES FROM 2.07
