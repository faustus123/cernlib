>Guidance
Insert objects from a pre-edited file.
The file contains only the values of the keys in the standard
horizontal or vertical mode of display. There should be the
letter N for every new key to be inserted in the appropriate
column; column 1 in the line with the keys of a given object for
Horizontal mode and column 20 in the first line describing the
keys for Vertical mode. Data part can be optionally added when
the program separately asks for the data.

>Guidance
Creates Directories, inserts or updates keys and data for a given
path name. There are two possible modes of operation for inserting
the key elements of the new object. In the horizontal mode, where
all the key elements are displayed in a single line, one should
insert 'N' in column 1 for every new object. To replace an existing
object (option R in CDSTOM), one has to put 'R' in front of the existing
object, followed by a new line with the keys of the new object with
'N' in front. In the vertical mode, all the keys are displayed in
seperate lines with one header line for every object. As in the
horizontal mode, one should insert character 'N' or 'R' in the header
line in column 20 (where the letter 'D' appears in the display).
Data can be optionally added to the object as requested by the
interactive program. Only vertical mode (one line for each data
element) is so far envisaged in this program.
Note : No compression of data is done.

CHOPT  'Character option'                       C D=' '
>Guidance
Copies a part of the directory tree from the current level, as specified
by the path name, downwards into a sequential file already opened in
output mode. The objects to be copied could be specified by a range of
serial number (default option) or by a minimum insertion time (option I
for HEPDB insertion time or option R for RZ insertion time). The output
is written in the format of the journal file, which can then be
subsequently used for updating a copy of the data base. With character
option 'F', the update mode of the compactification (when the journal
file will later be used) will make use data objects with matching user
keys. CHOPT will be followed by the range of serail numbers for default
option or the date and time (in YYMMDD and HHMM) corresponding to the
minimum insertion time.

CHOPT  'Character option'                       C D=' '
>Guidance
Deletes all directories from the data base except the ones specified
by the user. The program will prompt for the path names. The user
should type complete path names including top directory name. If the
updates of this session are saved in journal files, the user can
divert the updates in the special backup file using the character
option 'B'.

CFNAM  'Name of the auxiliary file'             C D=' '
>Guidance
Prepares an N-tuple from the data element(s) belonging to one or more
directories. The selection of the data objects is steered by CHOPT as
applied to the first directory. For subsequent directories, it tries
to match the time slot and selection on user keys is transmitted only
when the TAG of the appropriate user key in the first path matches
with the TAG of some user key in the current directory. The following
assignments of CHOPT have been used.
 CHOPT = 'T'  transforms the Keys 3,4,7 to seconds/minutes passed since
              midnight January 1, 1980
       = 'X'  assumes validity range packed ala CDPKTS
Creation of the Ntuple is guided by the parameters IDN, CTITL, CRZPA
and NPRIM. The user should first set the current directory to the
desired directory in memory by CDIR //pawc/mydir. One should also
have a histgram RZ file opened and should give appropriate CRZPA
to allow automatic overflow to that RZ file. The user is advised to
read HBOOK manual for more information on Ntuples.
Detail on data and key elements to be stored in the ntuples is by
default obtained from interactive enquiry. Optionally the user can
supply a file with contents of all these enquiries which are read
in free format from the program.
