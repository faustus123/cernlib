1 TAPEFORMAT
WARNING TO MAGTAPE USERS: In our data acquisition programs, we make use
of the byte-swap option in the magtape driver. See IBM VAX News 67 for
details. People who use magtape for other purposes should make sure that
the unit is in NOSWAP mode.
 Users who wish to put
the magtape into byte-swap mode must remember to MOUNT the tape before
issuing the     TAPEFORMAT SWAP     command
and they should do a     TAPEFORMAT NOSWAP     command
before DISMounting the tape.
