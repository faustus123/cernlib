C- Correct VMS deck EPIOVAX. (Previous correction in 1.73 was only valid 
C  for AXP).
C- Add flags WINNT and LINUX for Windows/NT and Linux.
C
C- Add LOGICAL BTEST in decks CFRIBMSF, CFRIBMSV, CTOIBSTF, CTOIBSTV.
C
C- Return ierr=1 from EPOPEN when cfopen returns negative status.
C   Extend this functionality to the VMS version in EPOPEN_VAX.
C   Typically, this occurs when the input file does not exist, but
C   recovery from any errors on opening files on reading and writing
C   is now possible.
C   Warning, one more argument for EPOPEN and EPOPEN_VAX, 
C   but they should not normally be user callable.
C   Related mods to EPBLIN, EPHEAD and EPTEST.
C
C   The Apollo version also suffers from this but the error handling
C    is a bit special, so more work is involved. Wait for a request.
