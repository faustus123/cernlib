C- Introduce CFIO for the Unix versions controlled by status word 33,
C    which is set by the user as follows;
C     Value       Type of I/O          Default filename (lun=nn)
C       0      Fortran sequential                for0nn
C       1      Fortran direct access             epionn
C       2      C using CFIO                      epionn
C
C  Although it is the old default, Value 0 is not portable and seems
C  to give more problems.
C  Values 1 and 2 give identical formats on most systems and are
C  portable.
C  With this version Status Word 33 will be set to 2 by default, but
C  it is user settable.
