C                     THE LENGTH OF THE RECORD OF A DISK FILE
C
C.    VERSION 1.56  : 32 bit words for physical header introduced as
C                     second possibilty.
C
C                     Default for simultaneously open units increased
C                     to 10.
C
C    *************    Default of flag 27 set to 1 (byte swapping). Users of
C    *************    the old EP format should set this flag to 0.
C
C                     New control word 29:
C                     If = 0 (default), ph. header written in 16 bit words
C                     If = 1 , ph. header written in 32 bit words.
C                     Reading is automatic.
C
C                     The test jobs have been modified accordingly. A new flag
C                     PH32BIT has been introduced. This flag can be switched
C                     on with ANY test job, and forces the usage of 32 bit
C                     physical headers.
C
C                     VAX EPIO_MACRO changed to allow status word 1 to be
C                     set > 62535.
C                     EPOPENS_VAX allows Decnet access for fixed block
C                     files, and common EPVAXCOM allows filenames up to
C                     255 (from 63).
C
C                     CRAY flag in EPFHDR corrected.
C                     CRAY versions of BLO16W, BUN16W, BLO32W, BUN32W
C                     corrected and faster.
C
C                     Apollo versions of CFRIBM and CTOIBM corrected.
C
C.    VERSION 1.57  : The physical header tests have been reordered
C                     to recognize definite 16-bit headers first in
C                     subroutine EPBLIN. This also required a correction
C                     to PTEST3 with 32-bit headers.
C
C                     Attempting to write a logical record greater than
C                     65535 words with a 16-bit logical record header
C                     gives error 24 in subroutine EPOUTL and no data
C                     is written.
C
C                     EPREAD gives error 23 if the logical record
C                     unit is neither 16 nor 32 and is positioned
C                     to read the next physical record.
C
C                     The patch INSTAL has been removed. Please see
C                     the INSTALL PAM.
C
C.    VERSION 1.58  : The CRAY versions of EPBLIN, EPBOUT now use the
C                     CRAY reading and writing routines.
C                     Bug fix in the CRAY version of BUN32W.
C                     APPEND option allowed in VAX open for
C                     output files via status word 30 set to 1
C                     TEST PATCH removed. See the INSTALL PAM file.
C
C.    VERSION 1.59  : The CRAY version of EPBLIN has been
C                     corrected for a misplaced modification.
C                     The CRAY and CDC versions of EPBOUT have been
C                     corrected for a misplaced modification.
C
C                     The test for trying to write too large a logical
C                     record with a 16-bit header has been improved in
C                     EPOUTL.
C
C                     The tests for invalid data in physical records
C                     with 32-bit headers have been improved in EPBLIN.
C
C                     Keyword SHARED added in the VAX OPEN for reading
C                     disk files
