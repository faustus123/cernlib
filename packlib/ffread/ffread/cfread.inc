C
C     Common CFREAD contains all information FFREAD knows about.
C     The variables contain the following:
C
C     NWORDS - # of words available in array IWORDS for key storage
C
C     NCHKEY - # of characters per key - default is four
C     NWDKEY - # of words per key
C     NKEYS  - # of keys currently defined
C     MAXKEY - maximum # of keys IWORDS will hold, considering NCHKEY and NWORDS
C
C    (NOFLOC)- offset for storage of addresses in IWORDS
C              (This is declared a parameter, as it is implicitly 0.)
C     NOFLEN - ditto for array lengths
C     NOFTYP - ditto for type field
C     NOFKEY - ditto for keys
C
C     LINPUT - # of significant characters on data card
C     LUNIN  - unit number for reading
C     LUNOUT - unit number for output
C
C     IFFOPT - character options for FFGET/FFSET
C     KEYOPT - character options for FFKEY
C
C     ISTACK - stack pointer into LUNS()
C     LUNS() - stack for reading from files
C
C     IWORDS - storage for keys, value locations, their length, and their type.
