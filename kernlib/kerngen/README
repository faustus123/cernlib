---------------------------------------------------------------------

The directories have he following contents:

ccgen     General C routines
ccgencf   the CF package of C routines
ccgenu    utility C routines used by CCGEN or CCGENCF
ccgenci   CIO package(Z311), Unix only.

xvect     XIN / XOUT routines

tcgen     all standard Fortran routines for KERNLIB,
          except: the ones found on KERNNUM Pam
                  the ones found also in ccgen, these are in tcgenc
                  the ones also in vms/vmsmlan, these are in tcgens

tcgenc    continuation of tcgen, has routines which are also in ccgen.
          
tcgens    continuation of tcgen, has routines which are also in vms/vmsmlan

obsolete/kernfor/tcnum     routines inherited from KERNNUM to make sure that
          GENSEC remains complete; this is not to be used for making
          a complete KERNLIB on machines where KERNNUM is ready;

obsolete/tcgenr    obsolete GENSEC routines
