              Update record for file MICKY


Update  2.71 :  12-June-1995
----------------------------

Replacing File   MICKY    2.70  940905 19.50

Correct:      TTRIGO: function ATG has been moved from Kernlib
              to Mathlib, Micky no longer tests this library function
              (but has a statement-function version in-line for testing
              the other trig. functions); re-write the tests a bit

              Micky will now exit with a warning status if there
              have been comparison failures:
              status = 1 on Unix and IBM, 9 on VAX

New Deck :    EXITRC    for the warning exit

New Patch:    PM434     to test VXINVB, VXINVC
