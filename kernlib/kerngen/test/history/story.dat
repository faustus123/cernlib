C.       CERN TC LIBRARY MICKY PAM.
C--------------------------------------------------------------------
C.
C.       A PROGRAM FOR TESTING OF ROUTINES CONTAINED IN THE CERN TC
C.       LIBRARY GENERAL SECTION PAM WITH AN OPTION TO MEASURE THEIR
C.       EXECUTION TIME.
C.
C.       THE PAM-FILE CONTAINS PILOT PATCHES FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
C.       COMPUTERS LIKE
C.
C.       P=*MAPO             APOLLO
C.       P=*MIBM             IBM 360 SERIES
C.       P=*MVAX             DIGITAL VAX
C.
C.       A RUN OF MICKY TO TEST ALL ROUTINES CATERED FOR IS OBTAINED BY
C.       REQUESTING THE APPROPRIATE PILOT PATCH.
C.       NO TIMING IS DEFAULT (ITIMES=0).
C.
C.       EXAMPLE
C.                 +EXE.
C.                 +USE, *MVAX.
C.                 +PAM.
C.
C.       TIMING IS OBTAINED BY GIVING
C.
C.                 +KEEP, TIMING.
C.                       ITIMES = 1
C.
C.
C.       HOW TO TEST AN INDIVIDUAL ROUTINE UCOPY WITH TIMING,
C.       ALL TIMING-LOOPS MADE 10 TIMES LONGER, IS SHOWN
C.       BY THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE:
C.
C.                 +USE, *MVAX.
C.                 +EXE, MICKY.
C.                 +EXE, PUTIL, D=TUCOPY.
C.                 +KEEP, EXECUTION.
C.                       ITIMES = 10
C.                       CALL TUCOPY
C.                 +PAM.
