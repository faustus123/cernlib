ROUTINES OF THE GENERAL SECTION PARTICULAR TO THE DEC PDP
 
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
FIRST RELEASE OF THE GENPDP MINI-PAM :  1-NOV-76
---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
THIS FILE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING PATCHES :
 
*KPDP10   PILOT-PATCH SELECTING THE FULL STANDARD GENERAL SECTION
 
REENTR    OPTION PATCH TO SELECT RE-ENTRANCE
 
UUOTAPOP  OPTION PATCH TO SELECT INSTALLATION FOR A SYSTEM
          WHICH PROVIDES THE NEW UUO 'TAPOP' (SEE D=TAPOP, QPDP9T)
 
HELP      UNIVERSAL MACRO DEFINITIONS
 
PDP10MLN  ML VERSIONS OF GENSEC ROUTINES IN NON-REENTRANT FORM
 
PDP10MLR  ML VERSIONS OF GENSEC ROUTINES IN     REENTRANT FORM
 
PDP10OBS  OBSOLETE GENSEC ROUTINES
 
=====================================================================
 
USAGE :
 
      THE FORTRAN AND THE ASSEMBLER ROUTINES HAVE TO BE COMPILED
      SEPARATELY, THEY MUST BE ON TWO SEPARATE PATCHY OUTPUT FILES.
      FOR THE ASSEMBLER ONE NEEDS IN ADDITION A THIRD FILE WHICH
      CONTAINS THE DEFINITION OF SOME MACRO INSTRUCTIONS.
 
      WITH PATCHY THESE THREE FILES CAN BE CREATED IN ONE GO WITH
      THE FOLLOWING CRADLE
 
              +EXE.
              +USE, REENTR.       IF AND ONLY IF RE-ENTRANCE
              +USE, UUOTAPOP.     IF AND ONLY IF THE 'TAPOP' UUO
              +USE, *KPDP10.
              +ASM, 22.           FILE FOR ASSEMBLER
              +ASM, 32.           FILE FOR DIVERTED ASSEMBLER
              +DIVERT, HELP.      DIVERT MACRO DEFINITIONS
              +PAM.               READ CONCATENATED KERNPDP + KERNFOR
 
 
      IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A REENTRANT LIBRARY YOU MUST GIVE UP
      SOME ASSEMBLER ROUTINES WHICH EXIST ONLY IN NON-REENTRANT FORM
      AND TAKE THEIR FORTRAN VERSION INSTEAD.
      THIS IS TRIGGERED BY   +USE, REENTR.
 
      SETTING INDUSTRY COMPATIBLE-MODE IS SOMEWHAT OF A MESS.
      TWO ALTERNATIVE ROUTINES ARE PROVIDED IN D=TAPOP, QPDP9T
      NEAR THE BEGINNING OF P=PDP10MLN, YOU BETTER LOOK AT THEM.
      TAPOP USES THE NEW UUO 'TAPOP', QPDP9T NEEDS SITE-DEPENDENT
      PARAMETERS.
 
      THIS GENERAL SECTION WAS USED ON CERN ERASME PDP10.
      CARE HAS BEEN TAKEN THAT IT DOES NOT CONTAIN KI10 CODE.
