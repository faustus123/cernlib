*
* CALLING SEQUENCE:     CALL ABUSER(NAME)
*
* FUNCTION:     SUPPLIES THE CERN FORTRAN ABEND PROCESSOR WITH THE
*               NAME OF A USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE TO BE CALLED
*               DURING ABEND PROCESSING.  THE ENTRY POINT ADDRESS
*               OF THE USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE IS STORED IN THE SCB
*               BY ISSUING THE ESTAE MACRO IN OVERRIDE MODE,  (IT IS
*               ASSUMED THAT THE CURRENT SCB IS THE ONE ESTABLISHED
*               BY IHOECOMH).  THE ENTRY POINT ADDRESS IS
*               SUBSEQUENTLY RECEIVED BY IHOSTAE IN THE SDWAPARM
*               FIELD OF THE SDWA.  THE USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE MUST
*               BE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING A CALL OF THE FORM
*               CALL NAME(KODES,KODEU) WHERE KODES WILL BE THE SYSTEM
*               COMPLETION CODE AND KODEU THE USER COMPLETION CODE.
*               ABUSER MAY BE CALLED AT ANY TIME DURING NORMAL PROGRAM
*               EXECUTION, (I.E. BEFORE ABEND), TO RE-SPECIFY THE
*               NAME OF THE USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE.  CALL ABUSER(0)
*               CAUSES THE NAME TO BE CANCELLED.  THE USER-SUPPLIED
*               SUBROUTINE WILL BE CALLED DURING ABEND PROCESSING TO
*               PERFORM PRE-TERMINATION CLEAN UP AND IS INTENDED TO
*               BE A USER-SUPPLIED EXTENSION OF ABEND PROCESSING.
*               THE USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE MUST BE IN VIRTUAL
*               STORAGE WHEN THE ABEND OCCURS (I.E. IT SHOULD BE
*               IN THE ROOT SEGMENT OF AN OVERLAY PROGRAM).
*
* ARGUMENTS:     NAME   - THE NAME OF A USER-SUPPLIED SUBROUTINE.
*                         IT MUST APPEAR IN AN EXTERNAL STATEMENT
*                         IN THE PROGRAM WHICH CALLS ABUSER.
