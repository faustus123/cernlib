ABUSER   CSECT
*
* CERN PROGLIB# Z036    ABUSER          .VERSION KERNIBM  2.11  850320
*
*********************************************************************
*
* FUNCTION:     RECORD THE ADDRESS OF A USER EXIT ROUTINE AND
*               SUBSEQUENTLY PASS CONTROL TO IT DURING ABEND
*               PROCESSING.  THE USER EXIT ROUTINE MUST BE ABLE TO
*               RECEIVE A CALL OF THE FORM 'CALL NAME(KODES,KODEU)'
*               WHERE KODES WILL BE THE SYSTEM COMPLETION CODE AND
*               KODEU THE USER COMPLETION CODE.  IT MUST RETURN
*               WHEN ITS PROCESSING IS COMPLETE.
*               ABUSER MAY BE CALLED AT ANY TIME DURING NORMAL
*               PROGRAM EXECUTION TO RE-SPECIFY THE ADDRESS OF THE
*               USER EXIT ROUTINE.  CALL ABUSER(0) CANCELS THE EFFECT
*               OF ALL PREVIOUS CALLS.
*
* CALLING SEQUENCE:     CALL ABUSER(NAME)
*
* ARGUMENTS:     NAME   - THE NAME OF THE USER EXIT ROUTINE WHICH
*                         MUST APPEAR IN A FORTRAN EXTERNAL STATEMENT
*
* ENTRY POINT:     REENT  - CALL REENT(NAME) HAS THE SAME EFFECT AS
*                           CALL ABUSER(NAME)
*
* NOTES:     THIS VERSION IS ONLY FOR USE IN A SIEMENS FORTRAN 77
*            ENVIRONMENT.  IT CALLS THE SIEMENS SERVICE SUBPROGRAM
*            ENDXIT.

* MODIFICATION LOG :
*
* 1.02 : CMS-COMPATIBLE CODE ADDED.
*        R. MATTHEWS, CERN/DD, DECEMBER 1984.
*
* 1.01 : MODIFIED TO TEST THE DETAIL CODE RECEIVED FROM THE FORTRAN
*        LIBRARY;  IF IT IS FOUND TO BE ZERO THE USER EXIT IS NOT
*        CALLED.  THIS MODIFICATION WAS MADE NECESSARY BY A CORRECTION
*        TO V10L20 OF THE FORTRAN LIBRARY WHICH CAUSES THE EXIT
*        IDENTIFIED IN THE CALL TO ENDXIT TO RECEIVE CONTROL FOR NORMAL
*        TERMINATION AS WELL AS ABNORMAL TERMINATION, (PREVIOUSLY
*        CONTROL WAS ONLY RECEIVED FOR ABNORMAL TERMINATION).
