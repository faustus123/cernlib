* CERN PROGLIB# M103    FLPSOR          .VERSION KERNCDC  1.05  780503
*
          ENTRY FLPSOR
*
*         THIS SUBROUTINE PACKAGES WAS ENTIRELY RECODED IN MARCH 74
*         TO OVERCOME A DESIGN BUG IN THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE, THAT,
*         DEPENDING ON THE SEQUENCE OF THE NUMBERS TO BE SORTED,
*         OVERWROTE A NUMBER BY ANOTHER ONE.
*         H. V. EICKEN, CERN, DD-DIVISION
*
*     PROGRAM  M103  TAKEN FROM CERN PROGRAM LIBRARY,  29-APR-78
*
* SUBROUTINE FLPSOR(A,N)
*
*         THIS SUBROUTINE SORTS FLOATING POINT NUMBERS
*         IT SORTS AN ARRAY INTO ITSELF
*         THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS * CALL FLPSOR ( ARRAY,NUMBER )
