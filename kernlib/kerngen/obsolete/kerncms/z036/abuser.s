* CERN PROGLIB# Z036    ABUSER          .VERSION KERNIBM  2.25  881103
*
* System :    VM / CMS
*
* Function:  Saves the address of a user specified exit routine
*            to which control is passed after an abend
*
* Called by:  EXTERNAL NAME
*             CALL ABUSER(NAME)  To set up user exit
*             CALL ABUSER(0)     To cancel existing exit
*        or:  CALL REENT(NAME)   to set up user exit
*             CALL REENT(0)      to cancel existing exit
*
*             ABUSER may be called at any time before an abend
*             to specify, respecify or cancel the user exit routine.
*
* Calls:      After an ABEND control is transferred to the user exit
*             routine via a call of the form CALL NAME(KODES,KODEU).
*             The two arguments kept only for compatibility with MVS
*             and are set to zero.
*             On return from the user exit routine control passes on
*             to the standard Fortran ABEND processing routines.
*
* Notes:      ABUSER uses storage in NUCON which must not be
*             overwritten:   8bytes at NUSERFWD
*                            8bytes at NUCCOPYR for CMS4 and previous
*                                      NUCUSER1 for CMS5 on

* Modification log:
*
* 1.00 Original version   Tony Cass  CERN/DD   19th July 1988
*
*********************************************************************
*
* 1.01 For XA change DMSKEY NUCLEUS to SPKA 224(0)
*                    DMSKEY USER       SPKA 0
*      For CMS 5 onwards use NUCUSER1 & NUCUSER2 instead of NUCCOPYR
*
* Tony Cass  CERN/DD   3rd November 1988
*
*********************************************************************
*
* 1.02 VS Fortran 2.5 generates an operation exception testing for
*      presence of hardware SQRT instruction. Add call to S#QRT so that
*      this exception does not lead to call to user exit routine.
