* CERN PROGLIB# Z262    GOPARM          .VERSION KERNIBM  2.23  880425
* ORIG. 01/12/85 RM, 22/9/87 HRR for VS Fortran Release 2
*
* FORTRAN CALLABLE ROUTINE TO OBTAIN THE PARM STRING PASSED WITH A
* START OR MODULE-NAME COMMAND IN VM/CMS RELEASE 3 WITH VS FORTRAN
* RELEASE 2. A TRIVIAL CHANGE IS NEEDED FOR VS FORTRAN RELEASE 1.
*
*              CALL GOPARM(LENGTH,PARMS)
*
* 1ST ARGUMENT= INTEGER LENGTH
* 2ND ARGUMENT= CHARACTER*100 PARMS  OR LOGICAL*1 PARMS(100)
* RETURNED     LENGTH IS THE INTEGER LENGTH OF PARMS
* RETURNED     PARMS IS THE UNTOKENIZED PARM LIST (SEE CMS USERS GUIDE)
*
*  THIS ROUTINE MAY BE USED FOR MODULES VIA
* MODULENAME PARAMETER-STRING
*  OR AFTER A LOAD IN THE START COMMAND VIA
* START ENTRY-NAME PARAMETER-STRING
*  NOTE THAT ANY (UNECESSARY) BRACKETS APPEAR AS PART OF THE STRING.
*  AFTER A LOAD WITH START AS OPTION NO PARAMETERS MAY BE GIVEN AND
*  A LENGTH OF ZERO IS RETURNED. THE MAXIMUM LENGTH RETURNED IS 100
*
*
* NOTE:  THIS VERSION OPERATES IN A VS FORTRAN RELEASE 2 ENVIRONMENT
* ONLY AS IT CALLS AFBVLCIN FROM THE RUN-TIME LIBRARY. FOR VS FORTRAN
* RELEASE 1 CHANGE THIS TO CALL IFYVLCIN.
*
* Version 1.01 January 1988
*
* Modified January 1988 to pick up the address of start and end
* of the parameter string from the Nucleus - this should work for
* all VSFortran Releases.
* Tony Cass CERN/DD
*
* Version 1.02 July 1991
*
* ... but not all CMS releases!
* On entry to the program R0 points to an extended plist, use this.
