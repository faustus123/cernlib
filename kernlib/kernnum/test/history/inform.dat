C          Installation of KERNCHK has been validated for patches
C                 APOLLO, CRAY, IBM, IBMRT and VAX,
C          but for none of the other patches mentioned above.
C
C          Use steering patch
C
C             NUMDPRNT      to generate diagnostics,
C             NUMEPRNT      to test error messages,
C             NUMESTOP      to test error stops,
