If you are the author (or responsible) of programs/execs you might want
to know whether your programs are being used and how. UMON is a service
machine which can supply such information via "usage monitors".
 
The following help file gives you an introduction to UMON.
 
WHAT CAN A MONITOR DO FOR YOU?
==============================
 
A monitor can note down on a "log-sheet"
 
  - when a program/exec was used,
  - by whom and
  - with which parameters.
 
By analyzing the file produced by the monitor you can determine with what
frequency your program/exec is being used and whether it is being used the
way it was meant to be used.
 
WHICH PROGRAMS CAN BE MONITORED?
================================
 
Any program which can execute the CP-command 'SMSG' can be monitored.
 
This means that at CERN any REXX exec, XEDIT macro, ASSEMBLER or FORTRAN
program can be monitored. The same is true for all programs calling a program
written in the above mentionned languages.
 
IS MONITORING DONE CONTINUOUSLY?
================================
 
Almost.
 
However, to allow implementation of new features UMON can be taken down on
Thursdays for one hour maximum (19.00-20.00). During this time monitoring is
not possible.
 
HOW TO START?
=================
 
 - Choose one of your existing minidisks or create (and FORMAT) a new one.
 - Execute the command 'DIRM MDISK' and
     . choose 'RR' as access mode (ensures read-only access on your side)
     . give it a WRITE password (enables your monitor to write on it)
 - MAIL the WRITE password and the name you want to give to YOUR monitor to
   BERND@CERNVM
 
We will then create the monitor for you and let you know about it. Once your
monitor exists you can  ACTIVATE and BLOCK it, MODIFY and KILL it with the
help of UMON commands. These commands also allow you to deal with the  "log-
sheets". The UMON commands are described in the (FINDable) help file
UMON_CMDS.
 
Attention: Programs to be monitored must contain a call to 'LOGUSAGE'. For more
           details consult the (FINDable help file) LOGUSAGE.
 
 
 
For any further questions, Please contact me by mail (BERND@CERNVM) or
phone (ext. 2407).
