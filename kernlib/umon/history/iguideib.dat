Necessary steps to be taken for UMON installation on VM
 
  0) Create a service machine named UMON
      - one minidisk 191, 1 cyl
      - privilege to execute the CP command MSGNOH
 
  1) Copy all the UMON files onto its A-disk
 
      - make sure that the file  MONITOR DEFINITIONS has the
        RECFM F and the LRECL 72
 
  2) Modify the UMON EXEC:
     Set the variable  UmonAdmin to the accounts of those users
     who should be entitled to Create monitors
 
  3) Start UMON and make sure that it is always running in a disconnected
     state
 
  4) Install the help files UMON_COMMANDS HELPINFO
                     and    UMON_INTRO    HELPINFO
 
       --------------------------------------
You now can test UMON by creating your first monitor
(same syntax as modify, but not mentioned in the helpfiles for
 reasons of confidentiality)
