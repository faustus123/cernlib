>Guidance
Plot a single histogram or a 2-Dim projection.
If ID=0 or ID=* all the histograms in the current directory are plotted.
Each plotted histogram will start either a new picture or a new zone in
the current picture.

 Histogram subranges can be specified in 2 different ways:
  1- h/pl id(ic1:ic2) with ic1 and ic2 integers means plot
                      from channel ic1 to channel ic2
  2- h/pl id(x1:x2)   with x1 and x2 reals (with a .) means plot
                      from channel corresponding to x1
  Note that the mixed mode h/pl id(x1:ic2) is also accepted
  This subrange works also for 2-DIM cases.
  Ex: Histo/plot 10(25:1.) or Histo/plot 20(4:18,0.:0.5).

A specific histogram cycle can be accessed:
  PAW > h/pl id;nc | cycle number nc is used (default is highest cycle)

1 Dim histograms could be plotted with option LEGO or SURF.
In this case the angles are THETA=1 and PHI=-1.
.
When option 'E' is used, the marker type can be changed with SET MTYP,
the marker size with SET KSIZ, the marker color with SET PMCI.
.
With Option E1, the size of the tick marks at the end of the error
bars is equal to the marker size and can be changed with SET KSIZ.
.
When the option E is used with the option SURF1, SURF2, SURF3 or LEGO1,
the colors are mapped on the errors not on the content of the histogram.
.
 To plot projection X of ID type
   PAW > HI/PLOT ID.PROX
 To plot band 1 in Y of ID type
   PAW > HI/PLOT ID.BANY.1
 To plot slice 3 in Y of ID type
   PAW > HI/PLOT ID.SLIY.3
.
In addition to the Cartesian coordinate systems, Polar, cylindrical,
spherical, pseudo-rapidity/phi coordinates are available for LEGO and
SURFACE plots, including stacked lego plots.
For example:
      PAW > Histo/plot 10+20+30  LEGO1,CYL | stacked cylindrical lego plot
      PAW > Histo/plot 10+20+30  LEGO1,POL |         polar
      PAW > Histo/plot 10+20+30  LEGO1,SPH |         spherical
      PAW > Histo/plot 10+20+30  LEGO1,PSD |         pseudo-rapidity/phi
Note that the viewing angles may be changed via the command ANGLES.
The axis, the front box, and the back box can be suppressed on 3D plots
with the options 'A', 'FB' and 'BB'.

-   Do the fit, plot the result and print the parameters.
-0  Do not plot the result of the fit. By default the fitted _
    function is drawn unless the option 'N' below is specified.
-N  Do not store the result of the fit bin by bin with the histogram._
    By default the function is calculated at the middle of each bin_
    and the fit results stored with the histogram data structure.
-Q  Quiet mode. No print
-V  Verbose mode. Results after each iteration are printed_
    By default only final results are printed.
-B  Some or all parameters are bounded. The vectors STEP,PMIN,PMAX_
    must be specified. Default is: All parameters vary freely.
-L  Use Log Likelihood. Default is chisquare method.
-D  The user is assumed to compute derivatives analytically using the_
    routine HDERIV. By default, derivatives are computed numerically.
-W  Sets weights equal to 1. Default weights taken from the square root_
    of the contents or from HPAKE/HBARX (PUT/ERRORS)._
    If the L option is given (Log Likelihood), bins with errors=0_
    are excluded of the fit.
-M  The interactive Minuit is invoked. (see Application HMINUIT below).
-E  Performs a better Error evaluation (MIGRAD + HESSE + MINOS).
-U  User function value is taken from /HCFITD/FITPAD(24),FITFUN.
-K  Keep the settings of Application HMINUIT for a subsequent command.

>Guidance
Fit a user defined (and parameter dependent) function
to a histogram ID (1-Dim or 2-Dim) in the specified range.
FUNC may be:
 A- The name of a file which contains the user defined
    function to be minimized. Function name and file name
    must be the same. For example file FUNC.FOR is:
      FUNCTION FUNC(X)   or FUNC(X,Y) for a 2-Dim histogram
      COMMON/PAWPAR/PAR(2)
      FUNC=PAR(1)*X +PAR(2)*EXP(-X)
      END
     Ex: His/fit 10 func.for ! 5 par
.
    When the option U is given, the file FUNC.FOR should look like:
      FUNCTION FUNC(X)   or FUNC(X,Y) for a 2-Dim histogram
      DOUBLE PRECISION FITPAD(24),FITFUN
      COMMON/HCFITD/FITPAD,FITFUN
      FITFUN=FITPAD(1)*X +FITPAD(2)*EXP(-X)
      FUNC=FITFUN
      END
.
 B- One of the following keywords (1-Dim only):
    G : to fit Func=par(1)*exp(-0.5*((x-par(2))/par(3))**2)
    E : to fit Func=exp(par(1)+par(2)*x)
    Pn: to fit Func=par(1)+par(2)*x+par(3)*x**2......+par(n+1)*x**n
     Ex: His/fit 10 g
.
 C- A combination of the keywords in B with the 2 operators + or *.
    Ex: His/Fit 10 p4+g ! 8 par
        His/Fit 10 p2*g+g ! 9 par
      Note that in this case, the order of parameters in PAR must
      correspond to the order of the basic functions.
      For example, in the first case above, par(1:5) apply to
      the polynomial of degree 4 and par(6:8) to the gaussian while
      in the second case par(1:3) apply to the polynomial of degree 2,
      par(4:6) to the first gaussian and par(7:9) to the second gaussian.
      Blanks are not allowed in the expression.

For cases A and C, before the execution of this command, the vector PAR
must be filled (via Vector/Input) with the initial values.
For case B, if NP is set to 0, then the initial values of PAR
will be calculated automatically.
After the fit, the vector PAR contains the new values
of parameters. If the vector ERRPAR is given, it will contain
the errors on the fitted parameters.
A bin range may be specified with ID.
  Ex. Histo/Fit 10(25:56).
.
When the Histo/it command is used in a macro, it might be convenient
to specify MINUIT directives in the macro itself via the Application
HMINUIT as described in this example:
     Macro fit
     Application HMINUIT exit
     name 1 par_name1
     name 2 par_name2
     migrad
     improve
     exit

>Guidance
Test of compatibility for two 1-Dim histograms ID1 and ID2.
A probability PROB is calculated as a number between zero and one,
where PROB near
one indicates very similar histograms, and PROB near zero
means that it is very unlikely that the two arose from the same
parent distribution.
For two histograms sampled randomly from the same distribution,
PROB will be (approximately) uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
See discussion in HBOOK manual under 'HDIFF- Statistical Considerations'.
By default (if no options are selected with CHOPT) the comparison
is done only on the shape of the two histograms, without consideration
of the difference in numbers of events, and ignoring all underflow and
overflow bins.

SMOOTH 'Smoothness parameter' R D=1. R=0.3:3.
>Guidance
Smooth a histogram or 'simple' ntuple.  ('simple' = 1, 2, or 3 variables.)
.
For multiquadric smoothing, SENSIT controls the sensitivity to statistical
fluctuations.  SMOOTH controls the (radius of) curvature of the
multiquadric basis functions.
.
Notes:
.
1) The multiquadric basis functions are SQRT(R**2+D**2), where R is
the distance from the 'centre', and D is a scale parameter and
also the curvature at the 'centre'.  'Centres' are located at
points where the 2nd differential or Laplacian of event density
is statistically significant.
.
2) The data must be statistically independent, i.e. events (weighted
or unweighted) drawn randomly from a parent probability
distribution or differential cross-section.
.
For spline smoothing, SENSIT and SMOOTH control the no. of knots (= 10 *
SENSIT) and degree of splines (= SMOOTH + 2) (thus if SENSIT and SMOOTH
are at their default values a 10-knot cubic spline is used).
.
Notes:
.
1) The spline option ALWAYS replaces the contents of a 2-D histogram.
(Also chi-squared is unavailable in this case.)
.
2) Use the SPLINE command for more flexibility.

>Guidance
The specified channels of the 1-Dim histogram ID are cumulated (rebinned)
into new bins. The final contents of the new bin is the average
of the original bins by default. If the option N is given, the final
contents of the new bin is the sum of the original bins.
Get contents and errors into vectors, grouping bins.
Bin width and centers are also extracted.
Allow to combine 2, 3 or more bins into one.
   E.g.:  REBIN 110 X Y EX EY 25 11 85
           will group by 3 channels 11 to 85  and return
           new abscissa, contents and errors.
           Errors in X are equal to 1.5*BINWIDTH.
   N.B.:
          REBIN ID X Y EX EY  is a convenient way to return in
          one call abscissa, contents and errors for 1-Dim histogram.

>Guidance
Create a Row_Wise_Ntuple. (See below how to create a Column_Wise_Ntuple).
The Ntuple may be created either purely in memory or possibly
using an automatic overflow to an RZ file.
Memory allocation works in the following way.
If CHRZPA = '  ', then a bank of NPRIME
words is created. When the space in this bank is exhausted at filling time,
a new linear structure of length NPRIME is created and this process will be
repeated should the structure become exhausted.
If CHRZPA contains the top directory name of an already existing RZ file (as
declared with HISTO/FILE), then a bank of length NPRIME is also created,
but at filling time, this bank is moved to the RZ file when full, and
then it is overwritten by any new entries.
The Ntuple can be filled by calling HFN from an interactively
defined subroutine called by the command NTUPLE/LOOP or by NTUPLE/READ.
The number of variables per data point is given in the parameter NVAR.
.
To create a Column_Wise_Ntuple, create a file, eg. newnt.f  with:
      Subroutine Newnt
*
*        Example of a COMIS subroutine to create a Ntuple interactively.
*        Data is read from a text input file

      character*8 mother,in1,in2

      common/ntupr/xover

      lout=42
      id=1
      open(unit=lin,file='datafile.dat',status='old')
      call hropen(lout,'NTUPLE','New_Ntuple.hbook','N',1024,istat)
*
      call hbnt(id,'New Ntuple',' ')
      call hbname(id,'ntupr',xover,'XOVER')
      call hbnamc(id,'ntupc',mother,'MOTHER:c*8,in1:c*8,in2:c*8')

.
Note that if there is a histogram in PAW memory that has the
same identifier as a histogram in one of the files to be merged,
then the contents of the histogram in memory are added to those of
the histogram in the file. This can be avoided by deleting the
memory histogram (using H/DEL) before issuing the HMERGE command.

-M      Create ID2 as a Memory resident Ntuple.
>Guidance
The structure of Ntuple ID1 is duplicated in a new ntuple ID2.
This command is useful when one wants to create an ntuple with the same
variables but only a subset of the events. NEWBUF is the buffer size
for ID2. If NEWBUF<0 the buffer size of ID1 is taken. If NEWBUF=0 the current
buffer size is taken (10000 words for RWNs). NEWBUF>0 will be the new
buffer size. If TITLE=' ' ID2 has the same title as ID1.
In case of a disk-resident ntuple (default), ID2 is created into the
current working directory which must be open in WRITE mode.
.
Example with a Row Wise Ntuple:
    Macro DUPRWN
    Close 0
    Hi/File 1 source.hbook
    Hi/File 2 new.hbook ! N
    Nt/Dup //lun1/30 2

          dup=1.
          end
    Quit
    *
    nt/loop //lun1/30 dup
    hrout 2

Note that the statement 'include ?' allows to create automatically the inlude
file (comis.inc) corresponding to the ntuple structure. The command UWFUNC
is not required in this case.

Scan the entries of an Ntuple subject to user cuts.
Scan the variables for NEVENT events starting at IFIRST, requiring that
the events satisfy cut UWFUNC. In the case of Alphanumeric output
Up to 8 variables may be scanned, the default is to scan the first 8
variables.
.
When the option S (Spider plot) is specified, each event is presented
in a graphical form (R versus PHI plot) to give a multi dimensional view of
the event. Each variable is represented on a separate axis with a scale
ranging from the minimum to the maximum value of the variable. A line joins
all the current points on every axis where each point corresponds to
the current value of the variable. When the HCOL parameter is specified
(eg SET HCOL 1002) a fill area is drawn.
.
VARLIS may contain a list of the original variables, expressions
of the original variables or/and ranges of variables.
A range can be given in the following form:
 :          means all variables (default).
 var1:var2  means from variable var1 to variable var2 included.
 var1:      means from variable var1 to the last.
 :var2      means from variable 1 to variable var2
.
For example, if IDN=30 has the 3 variables X,Y,Z,U,V,W one can do:
 PAW > scan 30
 PAW > scan 30 option=s
       each event is drawn as a spider plot.
 PAW > scan 30 option=sa
       each event is drawn as a spider plot and the average spider
       plot is also drawn.
 PAW > set 2BUF 1
 PAW > scan 30 option=s2

 PAW > scan 30 z>10 ! ! ! z abs(x) y+z x func.for
       where func.for is a COMIS function returning an expression
       of the original variables. This function func.for may be
       generated automatically by the PAW command:

IDH     'Identifier of histogram to fill' I D=1000000
>Guidance
Project and plot an Ntuple as a (1-Dim or 2-Dim) histogram
with automatic binning (ID=1000000), possibly using a selection
algorithm. See parameter CHOPT in command HISTO/PLOT to have
more details on the possible OPTION.
 IDN may be given as IDN
                     IDN.X
                     IDN.Y%X
                     IDN.1
                     IDN.2%1
                     IDN.expression1
                     IDN.expression1%expression2
Y%X means a scatter-plot Y(I) versus X(I) where I is the event number.
2%1 means a scatter-plot variable 2 versus variable 1.
In this example, X and Y are the names of the variables 1 and 2
respectively.
Expression 1 is any numerical expression of the Ntuple variables.
It may include a call to a COMIS function.
 UWFUNC may have the following forms:

 1- UWFUNC='0' or missing (only IDN given). No selection is applied.

 2- UWFUNC is a CUT or combination of valid CUTS created by the
    command NTUPLE/CUTS. Ex:
           UWFUNC=$1            means use cut $1
           UWFUNC=$1.AND.$2
           UWFUNC=.NOT.($1.AND.$2)
           UWFUNC=($1.OR.$2).AND.$3

 3- UWFUNC is a FORTRAN expression
    Ex:    X>3.14.AND.(Y<Z+3.15)

 4- UWFUNC is a variable name or an arithmetic expression
    Ex:   NT/PLOT 30.X Y  weight of each event is variable Y
          NT/PLOT 30.X X**2+Y**2

 5- UWFUNC is the name of a selection function in a text file with
    the name UWFUNC.FTN, UWFUNC.FOR, UWFUNC FORTRAN (Apollo, VAX, IBM).
The command UWFUNC may be used to generate automatically this function.
For example if IDN=30 is an Ntuple with 3 variables per event and 10000
events, then
    NTUPLE/PLOT 30.X SELECT.FOR
will process the 10000 events of the Ntuple IDN=30. For each event,
the function SELECT is called. It returns the weight of the event.
Example:
    FUNCTION SELECT(X)
    DIMENSION X(3)
    IF(X(1)**1+X(2)**2.LT.1.5)THEN
       SELECT=0.
    ELSE
       SELECT=1.
    ENDIF
    END
The file SELECT.FOR (VAX), SELECT.FTN (Apollo) or SELECT FORTRAN (IBM)
can be edited from PAW using the command EDIT. Note that if the suffix
(.FTN, .FORTRAN or .FOR) is omitted, then COMIS will start from the
precompiled version in memory and not from the file. Results of a
selection can be saved in a MASK (See NTUPLE/MASK).

 Ex: NT/PLOT 30.X Z<0.4>>MNAME(4)
     means mark bit 4 in mask MNAME for all events satisfying
     the condition Z<0.4

A MASK may also be given as input to a selection expression.

 Ex:  NT/PLOT 30.X MNAME(4).and.Z<0.4
      means all events satisfying bit 4 of MNAME AND Z<0.4

It is possible to plot expressions of the original variables.

 Ex 1:  NT/PLOT 30.SIN(X)%SQRT(Y**2+Z**2)  Z<0.4
     plots a scatter-plot of variable U versus V for all events
     satisfying the condition Z<0.4. U and V are defined as being
     U=SIN(X) and V=SQRT(X**2+Y**2)

 Ex 2:  NT/PLOT 30.FUNC.FTN(X)%(SIN(Y)+3.)  Z<0.2.and.TEST.FTN>6
     plots a scatter-plot of variable U versus V for all events
     satisfying the condition (Z<0.2 and the result of the COMIS
     function TEST.FTN >6). U and V are defined as being
     U=Result of the COMIS function FUNC.FTN,  V=SIN(Y)+3.

The default identifier of the histogram being filled is IDH=1000000.
At the next invocation of this command, it will be overwritten.

If either NEVENT or IFIRST or NUPD are negative, then the identifier
of the histogram being filled will be taken as IDH=-NEVENT or
IDH=-IFIRST or IDH=-NUPD. IDH may have been created with H/CREATE.
Before filling IDH, the contents of IDH are reset if IDH already
exists. Use NTUPLE/PROJECT to cumulate several passes into IDH.
Note that IDH not equal to 1000000 is a convenient way to force user
binning.

Every NUPD events, the current status of the  histogram is displayed.
>Action PANTUP

>Command CHAIN
>Parameters
+
CNAME 'Chain Name' C D=' '
ENTRY 'Chain Member(s) | -P Path' C D=' ' VARARG
>Guidance
Using the chain command one can build logical Ntuples of unlimited size.
The chain command creates an Ntuple chain CNAME and add member(s) ENTRY.
If the chain already exists the member is simply added.
More than one member may be specified at a time.
A chain can contain three different type of members: files,
logical units and other chains. The member type is deduced from the format
of the member. Entries containing the characters . / : ; $ are considered
to be files, entries like //LUN4 are assumed to be logical units
and all other type of entries are chains. Chain names must be unique.
After a chain has been defined it can be traversed, by all Ntuple
commands (NT/PLOT, NT/PROJ, NT/LOOP), by changing the current working
directory to the chain: CD //CNAME.

A member may be deleted from a chain by
preceding it by a - sign. A complete chain can be deleted by preceding
the chain name by a -. All chains can be deleted by giving a - as chain
name. Not specifying any parameters results in the listing of all defined
chains. A chain tree will be printed by appending a > character to the
chain name.

The path of all chain members, from chain CNAME downwards, can be changed
by specifying a chain path. This is done by giving a chain name followed
by the -P option and a path specification. The chain path will be pre-pended
to the member names. Chains down the tree can override a path specified
higher up in the tree.

 Examples of chain (Ntuple tree) definition:

 CHAIN   Year93  Jan Feb March April May ...
 CHAIN   Jan     Week1 Week2 Week3 Week4
 CHAIN   Week1   file1.hbook file2.hbook ...
 CHAIN   Week2   file3.hbook file4.hbook ...

 CD //Jan
 NT/PLOT 10.e     ; loop over all files in chains Week1, Week2, Week3, ...
 CD //Year93      ; loop over all files in chains Jan, Feb, March, ...
 CHAIN Year93 -P /user/delphi   ; all files from chain Year93 downward will
                                  be changed to /user/delphi/file1.hbook, ...

 CHAIN Year93>    ; print the chain tree Year93

For simple ntuples, with 1, 2 or 3 variables per event, this command will
draw a histogram with HPLOT options.  If the ntuple has an associated
functional representation, as the result, e.g., of using SMOOTH, it will
also draw the function.  No selections are allowed.

    For a 2-Dim projection, give up to 20 points to delimit_
    the selected area. The polygon will automatically_
    be closed by PAW.
-X  Same as G but with a tracking cross cursor.
-P  Print definition of cut CUTID.
--  Reset cut CUTID.
-R  Read definition of cut CUTID from file FNAME.
-W  Write definition of cut CUTID on file FNAME (text file).
-D  Draw cut contour.
FNAME 'File name' C D=' '
WKID  'Workstation identifier' I D=1
>Guidance
Define the CUTID with the format $nn.
nn is an integer between 1 and 99.
This cut can then be used in subsequent commands NTUPLE/PLOT, PROJECT.

  OPTION='expression'  allows to define the cut CUTID. For example
  the command:

   PAW > CUTS $1 X<0.8.and.Y<SQRT(X)

  defines the cut $1.

Note that CUTID=$0 means all cuts except for 'G' option.
When option G is selected, graphical cuts are only operational
for plots of the original Ntuple variables, not for expressions
of these variables.
WKID allows to define in which window the locator is performed
(option 'G' or 'X' only).

-N A new mask on file MNAME.MASK is created for NUMBER events.
-P The comments for all active bits is printed.
-C Mask is closed.
-R Reset bit number NUMBER.If NUMBER=99, resets all bits.
NUMBER 'Bit number' I D=0
>Guidance
Perform Operations with masks.
A mask is a direct-access file with the name MNAME.MASK.
It must contain as many 32 bit words as there are events
in the associated Ntuple.
Masks are interesting when only a few events of a Ntuple are selected
with a time consuming selection algorithm. For example if the command:
   NT/PLOT 30.X  Z<0.4.AND.SELECT.FTN>>MNAME(6)
then for all events in Ntuple 30 satisfying the condition above,
the bit 6 in the corresponding mask words will be set. One can then use
the mask as selection mechanism. Example:
   NT/PLOT 30.X MNAME(6)
will produce the same results than the NT/PLOT command above, but
will be much faster if only a small fraction of all the events
is selected.
MASKS are automatically saved across PAW sessions on files.
Example:
   MASK  TEST N 10000
      creates a new mask on file TEST.MASK with enough words to
      process a Ntuple with 10000 events
   MASK  TEST UP
      opens an existing mask for update and
      prints the active selection bits with explanation

-T Names of the Ntuple variables are generated in DATA statements _
   (not valid for new Ntuples).
>Guidance
To generate the FORTRAN skeleton of a selection function or the
INCLUDE file with the columns declaration.
.
A FORTRAN function is generated if the FNAME is of the form,
xxx.f, xxx.for, xxx.fortran. Otherwise an INCLUDE file is generated.
Example:
If Ntuple ID=30 has variable names [X,Y,Z,ETOT,EMISS,etc] then:
.
NTUPLE/UWFUNC 30 SELECT.FOR   will generate the file SELECT.FOR with:
      FUNCTION SELECT(XDUMMY)
      COMMON/PAWIDN/IDNEVT,VIDN1,VIDN2,VIDN3,X,Y,Z,ETOT,EMISS,etc
*
      SELECT=1.
      END
Then using the command EDIT one can modify this file which could then
look something like (IDNEVT is the event number):
      FUNCTION SELECT(XDUMMY)
      COMMON/PAWIDN/IDNEVT,VIDN1,VIDN2,VIDN3,X,Y,Z,ETOT,EMISS,etc
*
      IF(X**2+Y**2.GT.Z**2.OR.ETOT.GT.20.)THEN
         SELECT=1.
      ELSE
         SELECT=0.
      ENDIF
      END
If in a subsequent command NTUPLE/PLOT, the selection function SELECT
is used, then:
   If NTUPLE/PLOT 30.ETOT SELECT.FOR
      VIDN1=ETOT
   If NTUPLE/PLOT 30.SQRT(X**2+Y**2)%(ETOT-EMISS)
      VIDN1=ETOT-EMISS
      VIDN2=SQRT(X**2+Y**2)
.
NTUPLE/UWFUNC 30 SELECT.INC will generate an include file. This include file
may be referenced in a selection function in the following way:
      FUNCTION SELECT(XDUMMY)
      include 'select.inc'
*
      SELECT=1.
      IF(X.LE.Y)SELECT=0.
      END
.
Note that the command UWFUNC is not required if the SELECT function has the
following form:
      FUNCTION SELECT(XDUMMY)
      include ?
*
      SELECT=1.
      IF(X.LE.Y)SELECT=0.
      END
In this case (thanks to the statement 'include ?') the include file will be
generated automatically with the name 'comis.inc'.

>Guidance
Data reduction on Ntuple.
The method used is the PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS.
The Principal Components Analysis method consists in applying
a linear transformation to the original variables of a ntuple.
This transformation is described by an orthogonal matrix and
is equivalent to a rotation of the original space to a new set
of coordinates vectors, which hopefully provide easier identification
and dimensionality reduction. This matrix is real positive definite
and symmetric and has all its eigenvalues greater than zero.
Among the family of all complete orthonormal bases, the basis
formed by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and belonging
to the largest eigenvalues corresponds to the most significant features
for the description of the original ntuple.

Reduction of the variables for NEVENT events starting at IFIRST
The default is to take all the 20 first variables.

This command creates a file : -> XTOXSI.FORTRAN or xtoxsi.for,xtoxsi.ftn.
This file contains a Fortran function which computes the new variables.
These new variables can be visualized in PAW with for example:
 PAW > Ntuple/plot id.xtoxsi.ftn(1)
 PAW > Ntuple/plot id.xtoxsi.ftn(1)%xtoxsi.ftn(3)

Ntuple columns during Ntuple analysis. The default is 10 MB. Giving
a value of 0 turns the buffer facility off. The upper limit is 128 MB,
but be sure you have enough swap space and realize that when the buffer
is swapped to disk you loose part of the benefit of the buffer facility
(which is to reduce the number of disk accesses). Omitting the argument
or specifying -1 will show you the current upper limit and used and free
space. Giving -2 shows which columns are currently stored in memory.

Interface to MINUIT, COMIS, SIGMA and FORTRAN Input/Output.

>Command HMINUIT
>Guidance
To input commands for Interactive MINUIT in a macro.
Example:
 Application HMINUIT EXIT
 SET EPS 1.E-14
 MIGRAD
 SET PRIN 2
 MINOS
 EXIT
 Histo/fit 10 g m
>Action PAFORT

>Command COMIS
>Guidance
Invoke the COMIS FORTRAN interpreter.
COMIS allows to execute FORTRAN routines without recompiling
and relinking. It communicates
with PAW commands through vectors and functions. COMIS has its
PAW-independent command structure.
Example in command mode:
 PAW > Comis
 CS >    do 10 i=1,10
 MND>       x=sqrt(i)*10.
 MND>       print *,i,x
 MND> 10 continue
 MND>    END
 CS > quit
 PAW >
COMIS code may be inserted into a macro. Example:
 Vector/Create Y(10) r 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 *
 *  In the following COMIS code, the statement 'Vector Y' declares
 *  to COMIS an existing KUIP vector. KUIP dimension is assumed.
 *  The statement 'Vector X(10)' creates a new KUIP vector.
 *  (Note that SUBROUTINEs must be declared before the MAIN program)
 *  (KUIP vectors cannot be created into the MAIN program)
 *
 APPLIcation COMIS QUIT
       SUBROUTINE DEMO
       Vector Y
       Vector X(10)
       do 10 i=1,10
          XX=i
          X(i)=Y(i)*sqrt(XX)*10.
   10  CONTINUE
       END
       CALL DEMO
       END
 QUIT
 Vector/print X       | Print KUIP vector created by COMIS
>Action PAFORT

>Command CALL
>Parameters
UROUT 'User routine' C
>Guidance
Execute the routine UROUT.
UROUT may be a routine compiled and linked with PAW.
For example : CALL HPRINT(10).
.
UROUT may also be the name of a file which can be edited interactively
with the command EDIT. For example if file UROUT.FOR contains:

     SUBROUTINE UROUT(N)
     SUM=0.
     DO 10 I=1,N
       SUM=SUM+I
  10 CONTINUE
     PRINT *,SUM
     END
Then one can type CALL UROUT.FOR(10). The routine UROUT may also
contain references to the library routines mentioned below.
.
The functions $CALL, $ICALL, and $DCALL allow to call REAL, INTEGER,
and DOUBLE PRECISION functions, respectively.
The function call must be enclosed in quotes, for example:

     $CALL('fun.f(1.5)')

with file fun.f containing

     FUNCTION FUN(X)
     FUN=X**2
     END
.
The following routines from the CERN Program Library can be called:
>User_help PAHELP
>Action PAFORT

>Command LOOP
>Parameters
NTIMES 'Number of calls' I D=1
UROUT  'User routine' C
>Guidance
The routine UROUT is called NTIMES times.
See command CALL for explanation of UROUT.
>Action PAFORT

>Command FILE
>Parameters
LUN 'Logical unit number' I
FNAME 'File name' C
+
STATUS 'File status' C D=DONTKNOW Option
-OLD        Open existing file for reading.
-APPEND     Open existing file and position at EOF.
-NEW        Create new file; error if already existing.
-UNKNOWN    Open existing or create new file.
-DONTKNOW   Like UNKNOWN except on VMS opens highest cycle.
>Guidance
Open a FORTRAN formatted text file.

UNKNOWN opens a file for write access without flagging an error if the
file already exists.  On VMS a new cycle is created.
DONTKNOW is the same as UNKNOWN except on VMS
where the highest cycle is opened.
This option should be used if it is not yet known whether the file will
be read or written.
>Action PAFORT

>Command CLOSE
>Parameters
LUN 'Logical unit number' I R=0:128
>Guidance
Close the file on unit LUN.
If the file has been opened with HISTO/FILE, PICTURE/FILE, etc, then
before closing the unit, PAW will close correctly the file with
CALL HREND or FZENDI(O), ICLWK, etc.
Giving 0 as unit will close all open files.
>Action PAFORT

>Command UNITS
>Parameters
>Guidance
List all Input/Output logical units currently open.
The files attached to them are also shown.
>Action PAFORT

>Command REWIND
>Parameters
LUN 'Logical unit number' I R=1:128
>Guidance
Rewind the file on unit LUN.
>Action PAFORT

>Command SIGMA
>Parameters
+
EXPR 'Expression' C D=' '
>Guidance
Invoke the SIGMA package.
SIGMA is an array manipulation package using its own
vector-oriented language, outside the PAW command conventions.
SIGMA may be invoked in one of the three following ways:
 1- Using the KUIP $SIGMA function. Example:
    PAW > Vector/Create x(10) r 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    PAW > Graph 10 x $sigma(sqrt(x))
.
 2- Using the SIGMA command. Example:
    PAW > sigma x=array(10,1#10)
    PAW > sigma y=sqrt(x)
    PAW > Graph 10 x y
.
 3- Using the APPLication command. Example:
    PAW > APPLication SIGMA
    SIGMA > x=array(10,1#10)
    SIGMA > y=sqrt(x)
    SIGMA > exit
    PAW > Graph 10 x y
>Action PASIGM
