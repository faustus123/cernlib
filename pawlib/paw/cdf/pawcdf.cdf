>Guidance
Plot a single histogram or a 2-Dim projection.
If ID=0 or ID=* all the histograms in the current directory are plotted.
Each plotted histogram will start either a new picture or a new zone in
the current picture.
.
Histogram subranges can be specified in 2 different ways:
.
  PAW > h/pl id(ic1:ic2) | with ic1 and ic2 integers means plot
                         | from channel ic1 to channel ic2
  PAW > h/pl id(x1:x2)   | with x1 and x2 reals (with a .) means plot
                         | from channel corresponding to x1
.
Note that the mixed mode h/pl id(x1:ic2) is also accepted. 
.
If ic1 or x1 are omitted, the first channel is used. If ic2 or x2 are omitted,
the last channel is used.
.
  PAW > h/pl 10(:20)     | equivalent to h/pl 10(1:20)
  PAW > h/pl 10(20:)     | plot from channel 20 to the last channel
.
This subrange works also for 2-DIM cases. Example:
.
  PAW > Histo/plot 10(25:1.) 
  PAW > Histo/plot 20(4:18,0.:0.5)
.
A specific histogram cycle can be accessed:
.
  PAW > h/pl id;nc | cycle number nc is used (default is highest cycle)
.
1 Dim histograms could be plotted with option LEGO or SURF.
In this case the angles are THETA=1 and PHI=-1.
.
When option 'E' is used, the marker type can be changed with SET MTYP,
the marker size with SET KSIZ, the marker colour with SET PMCI.
.
With Option E1, the size of the tick marks at the end of the error
bars is equal to the marker size and can be changed with SET KSIZ.
.
When the option E is used with the option SURF1, SURF2, SURF3 or LEGO1,
the colours are mapped on the errors not on the content of the histogram.
.
Options LOGX and LOGY are not active on contour plots (option CONT). ie: 
contour plots are always plotted with linear scales along X and Y axis.
.
To plot projection X of ID type
.
  PAW > HI/PLOT ID.PROX
.
To plot band 1 in Y of ID type
.
  PAW > HI/PLOT ID.BANY.1
.
To plot slice 3 in Y of ID type
.
  PAW > HI/PLOT ID.SLIY.3
.
In addition to the Cartesian coordinate systems, Polar, cylindrical,
spherical, pseudo-rapidity/phi coordinates are available for LEGO and
SURFACE plots, including stacked lego plots.
For example:
.
      PAW > Histo/plot 10+20+30  LEGO1,CYL | stacked cylindrical lego plot
      PAW > Histo/plot 10+20+30  LEGO1,POL |         polar
      PAW > Histo/plot 10+20+30  LEGO1,SPH |         spherical
      PAW > Histo/plot 10+20+30  LEGO1,PSD |         pseudo-rapidity/phi
.
Note that the viewing angles may be changed via the command ANGLES.
The axis, the front box, and the back box can be suppressed on 3D plots
with the options 'A', 'FB' and 'BB'.

    function is drawn unless the option 'N' below is specified.
-S  Superimpose plot on top of existing picture.
-N  Do not store the result of the fit bin by bin with the histogram._
    By default the function is calculated at the middle of each bin_
    and the fit results stored with the histogram data structure.
-Q  Quiet mode. No print
-V  Verbose mode. Results after each iteration are printed_
    By default only final results are printed.
-B  Some or all parameters are bounded. The vectors STEP,PMIN,PMAX_
    must be specified. Default is: All parameters vary freely.
-L  Use Log Likelihood. Default is chisquare method.
-D  The user is assumed to compute derivatives analytically using the_
    routine HDERIV. By default, derivatives are computed numerically.
-W  Sets weights equal to 1. Default weights taken from the square root_
    of the contents or from HPAKE/HBARX (PUT/ERRORS)._
    If the L option is given (Log Likelihood), bins with errors=0_
    are excluded of the fit.
-M  The interactive Minuit is invoked. (see Application HMINUIT below).
-E  Performs a better Error evaluation (MIGRAD + HESSE + MINOS).
-U  User function value is taken from /HCFITD/FITPAD(24),FITFUN._

Fit a user defined (and parameter dependent) function
to a histogram ID (1-Dim or 2-Dim) in the specified range.
FUNC may be:
.
A) The name of a file which contains the user defined
function to be minimised. Function name and file name
must be the same. The function must be of type REAL. 
For example file 'func.f' is:
.
      REAL FUNCTION FUNC(X)   or FUNC(X,Y) for a 2-Dim histogram
      COMMON/PAWPAR/PAR(2)
      FUNC=PAR(1)*X +PAR(2)*EXP(-X)
      END
.
  PAW > His/fit 10 func.f ! 2 par
.
To do fitting in DOUBLE PRESICION option U should be used. In that case, 
the file 'func.f' should look like:
.
      REAL FUNCTION FUNC(X)   or FUNC(X,Y) for a 2-Dim histogram
      DOUBLE PRECISION FITPAD(24),FITFUN
      COMMON/HCFITD/FITPAD,FITFUN
      FITFUN=FITPAD(1)*X +FITPAD(2)*EXP(-X)
      FUNC=FITFUN
      END
.
B) One of the following keywords (1-Dim only):
.
 G : to fit Func=par(1)*exp(-0.5*((x-par(2))/par(3))**2)
 E : to fit Func=exp(par(1)+par(2)*x)
 Pn: to fit Func=par(1)+par(2)*x+par(3)*x**2......+par(n+1)*x**n
.
  PAW > His/fit 10 G
.
C) A combination of the keywords in B with the 2 operators + or *.
.
  PAW > His/Fit 10 p4+g ! 8 par
  PAW > His/Fit 10 p2*g+g ! 9 par
.
In this case, the order of parameters in PAR must correspond to the order of the
basic functions. For example, in the first case above, par(1:5) apply to the 
polynomial of degree 4 and par(6:8) to the Gaussian while in the second case 
par(1:3) apply to the polynomial of degree 2, par(4:6) to the first Gaussian and
par(7:9) to the second Gaussian.  Blanks are not allowed in the expression.
.
For cases A and C, before the execution of this command, the vector PAR must be
filled (via Vector/Input) with the initial values. For case B, if NP is set to 
0, then the initial values of PAR will be calculated automatically. After the 
fit, the vector PAR contains the new values of parameters. If the vector ERRPAR 
is given, it will contain the errors on the fitted parameters. A bin range may
be specified with ID.
.
  PAW > Histo/Fit 10(25:56).
.
When the Histo/it command is used in a macro, it might be convenient to specify 
MINUIT directives in the macro itself via the Application HMINUIT as described 
in this example:
.
     Macro fit
     Application HMINUIT exit
     name 1 par_name1
     name 2 par_name2
     migrad
     improve
     exit
     Histo/fit id fitfun.f M
     Return
.
Some plotting options available in the command HISTOGRAM/PLOT can be also used.

>Keyword
compare comparison
>Guidance
Test of compatibility for two 1-Dim histograms ID1 and ID2.
A probability PROB is calculated as a number between zero and one,
where PROB near
one indicates very similar histograms, and PROB near zero
means that it is very unlikely that the two arose from the same
parent distribution.
For two histograms sampled randomly from the same distribution,
PROB will be (approximately) uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
See discussion in HBOOK manual under 'HDIFF- Statistical Considerations'.
By default (if no options are selected with CHOPT) the comparison
is done only on the shape of the two histograms, without consideration
of the difference in numbers of events, and ignoring all underflow and
overflow bins.

>Keyword
multi-quadric spline B-spline
>Guidance
Smooth a histogram or 'simple' ntuple.  ('simple' = 1, 2, or 3 variables.)
.
For multi-quadric smoothing, SENSIT controls the sensitivity to statistical
fluctuations.  SMOOTH controls the (radius of) curvature of the
multi-quadric basis functions.
.
Notes:
.
1) The multi-quadric basis functions are SQRT(R**2+D**2), where R is
the distance from the 'centre', and D is a scale parameter and
also the curvature at the 'centre'.  'Centres' are located at
points where the 2nd differential or Laplacian of event density
is statistically significant.
.
2) The data must be statistically independent, i.e. events (weighted
or unweighted) drawn randomly from a parent probability
distribution or differential cross-section.
.
For spline smoothing, SENSIT and SMOOTH control the no. of knots (= 10 *
SENSIT) and degree of splines (= SMOOTH + 2) (thus if SENSIT and SMOOTH
are at their default values a 10-knot cubic spline is used).
.
Notes:
.
1) The spline option ALWAYS replaces the contents of a 2-D histogram.
(Also chi-squared is unavailable in this case.)
.
2) Use the SPLINE command for more flexibility.

Ntuple creation and related operations.
.
An Ntuple is a set of events, where for each event the value of a number of 
variables is recorded. An Ntuple can be viewed as a table with each row 
corresponding to one event and each column corresponding to given variable. 
The interesting 
properties of the data in an Ntuple can normally be expressed as 
distributions of Ntuple variables or as correlations between two or more of 
these variables. Very often it is useful to create these distributions from
a subset of the data by imposing cuts on some of the variables. 
.
Typically, an Ntuple is made 
available to PAW by opening a direct access file; this file, as been previously 
created 
with an program using HBOOK. A storage area for an Ntuple may also be created 
directly using NTUPLE/CREATE; data may then be stored in the allocated space 
using the NTUPLE/LOOP or NTUPLE/READ commands. Other commands merge Ntuples 
into larger Ntuples, project vector functions of the Ntuple variables into 
histograms, and plot selected subsets of events.

>Guidance
Create a Row_Wise_Ntuple. (See below how to create a Column_Wise_Ntuple).
The Ntuple may be created either purely in memory or possibly
using an automatic overflow to an RZ file.
Memory allocation works in the following way.
If CHRZPA = '  ', then a bank of NPRIME
words is created. When the space in this bank is exhausted at filling time,
a new linear structure of length NPRIME is created and this process will be
repeated should the structure become exhausted.
If CHRZPA contains the top directory name of an already existing RZ file (as
declared with HISTO/FILE), then a bank of length NPRIME is also created,
but at filling time, this bank is moved to the RZ file when full, and
then it is overwritten by any new entries.
The Ntuple can be filled by calling HFN from an interactively
defined subroutine called by the command NTUPLE/LOOP or by NTUPLE/READ.
The number of variables per data point is given in the parameter NVAR.
.
To create a Column_Wise_Ntuple, create a file, eg. newnt.f  with:
.
         Subroutine Newnt
   *
   *        Example of a COMIS subroutine to create a Ntuple interactively.
   *        Data is read from a text input file

         open(unit=lin,file='datafile.dat',status='old')
         call hropen(lout,'NTUPLE','New_Ntuple.hbook','N',1024,istat)
   *
         call hbnt(id,'New Ntuple',' ')

         call hrend('NTUPLE')
         close (lin)

>Guidance
Merge HBOOK files containing histograms and/or ntuples. Ntuples are merged
and histograms with the same ID are added. The INFILES are merged into a new
file OUTFILE. If OUTFILE already exists, it is overwritten.
.
If there are histograms in PAW memory that have same
identifiers as histograms in one of the files to be merged,
then the contents of the histograms in memory are added to those of
the histograms in the file. This can be avoided by deleting the
memory histogram (using H/DEL) before issuing the HMERGE command.
.
By default HMERGE uses the automatic record length determination
to open the input files. This works for files with a record 
length smaller or equal to 8191 words. For files with a larger
record length the following syntax can be use.
.
  PAW > hmerge LRECL 16384                   | New LRECL
   Next HMERGE will use LRECL = 16384
  PAW > hmerge out.hbook in1.hbook in2.hbook | Use the new LRECL
.
To go back to the automatic record length determination mode just do:
.
  PAW > hmerge LRECL 0
   Next HMERGE will use the auto-record length detection
.
All the input files should have the same record length.

>Keyword
copy
>Guidance
The structure of Ntuple ID1 is duplicated in a new ntuple ID2.
This command is useful when one wants to create an ntuple with the same
variables but only a subset of the events. NEWBUF is the buffer size
for ID2. If NEWBUF<0 the buffer size of ID1 is taken. If NEWBUF=0 the current
buffer size is taken (10000 words for RWNs). NEWBUF>0 will be the new
buffer size. If TITLE=' ' ID2 has the same title as ID1.
In case of a disk-resident ntuple (default), ID2 is created into the
current working directory which must be open in WRITE mode.
.
Example with a Row Wise Ntuple:
    Macro DUPRWN
    Close 0
    Hi/File 1 source.hbook
    Hi/File 2 new.hbook ! N
    Nt/Dup //lun1/30 2

          end
    Quit
    *
    nt/loop //lun1/30 dup
    hrout 2

Note that the statement 'include ?' allows to create automatically the include
file (comis.inc) corresponding to the ntuple structure. The command UWFUNC
is not required in this case.

Scan the entries of an Ntuple subject to user cuts.
Scan the variables for NEVENT events starting at IFIRST, requiring that
the events satisfy cut UWFUNC. In the case of Alphanumeric output
Up to 10 variables may be scanned, the default is to scan the first 10
variables.
.
When the option S (Spider plot) is specified, each event is presented
in a graphical form (R versus PHI plot) to give a multi dimensional view of
the event. Each variable is represented on a separate axis with a scale
ranging from the minimum to the maximum value of the variable. A line joins
all the current points on every axis where each point corresponds to
the current value of the variable. When the HCOL parameter is specified
(eg SET HCOL 1002) a fill area is drawn.
When the additional option A is specified, a spider plot of the average
value for each variable is also drawn.
When the option S2 (Segment plot) is specified, wedges are drawn along 
each axis instead of the line joining the points. 
.
NB : a minimum of three variables in VARLIS is required for any graphical 
plot. 
.
VARLIS may contain a list of the original variables, expressions
of the original variables or/and ranges of variables.
A range can be given in the following form:
 :          means all variables (default).
 var1:var2  means from variable var1 to variable var2 included.
 var1:      means from variable var1 to the last.
 :var2      means from variable 1 to variable var2
.
For example, if IDN=30 has the 3 variables X,Y,Z,U,V,W one can do:
 PAW > scan 30
 PAW > scan 30 option=s
       each event is drawn as a spider plot.
 PAW > scan 30 option=sa
       each event is drawn as a spider plot and the average spider
       plot is also drawn.
 PAW > set 2BUF 1
 PAW > scan 30 option=s2
 More...? ( <CR>/N/G ) G
       answering 'G' with double buffer on, create a graphical
       animation of the ntuple content.
 PAW > scan 30 option=s  X:Z W
 PAW > scan 30 varlis=X:Z W
 PAW > scan 30 z>10
 PAW > scan 30 z>10 ! ! ! z abs(x) y+z x func.for
       where func.for is a COMIS function returning an expression
       of the original variables. This function func.for may be
       generated automatically by the PAW command:
 PAW > uwfunc 30 func.for

more details on the possible OPTION.
IDN may be given as:
.
          IDN.X
          IDN.Y%X
          IDN.Y%X%Z
          IDN.Y%X%Z%T

          IDN.expression1%expression2%expression3%expression4
.
Y%X means a scatter-plot Y(I) versus X(I) where I is the event number.
In this example, X and Y are the names of the variables 1 and 2
respectively.
.
expression1 is any numerical expression of the Ntuple variables.
It may include a call to a COMIS function.
.
Y%X%Z means a 3D scatter-plot Z(I) versus Y(I) versus X(I) where I is 
the event number. If option "G" is given, three Gouraud shaded surfaces
are drawn. The green one is the average.
.
Y%X%Z%T means a 3D scatter-plot Z(I) versus Y(I) versus X(I) where I is 
the event number. T is mapped on the colour map.
.
UWFUNC may have the following forms:
.
 1- UWFUNC='0' or missing (only IDN given). No selection is applied.

 2- UWFUNC is a CUT or combination of valid CUTS created by the
    command NTUPLE/CUTS. Ex:
           UWFUNC=$1            means use cut $1
           UWFUNC=$1.AND.$2
           UWFUNC=.NOT.($1.AND.$2)
           UWFUNC=($1.OR.$2).AND.$3

 3- UWFUNC is a FORTRAN expression
    Ex:    X>3.14.AND.(Y<Z+3.15)

 4- UWFUNC is a variable name or an arithmetic expression
    Ex:   NT/PLOT 30.X Y  weight of each event is variable Y
          NT/PLOT 30.X X**2+Y**2

 5- UWFUNC is the name of a selection function in a text file with
    the name UWFUNC.F, UWFUNC.FTN, UWFUNC.FOR, UWFUNC FORTRAN 
    (Unix, Apollo, VAX, IBM).
.
The command UWFUNC may be used to generate automatically this function.
For example if IDN=30 is an Ntuple with 3 variables per event and 10000
events, then
.
   NTUPLE/PLOT 30.X select.f
.
will process the 10000 events of the Ntuple IDN=30. For each event,
the function SELECT is called. It returns the weight of the event.
Example:
.
    FUNCTION SELECT(X)
    DIMENSION X(3)
    IF(X(1)**1+X(2)**2.LT.1.5)THEN
       SELECT=0.
    ELSE
       SELECT=1.
    ENDIF
    END
.
The file select.f
can be edited from PAW using the command EDIT. Note that if the suffix
(.F, .FTN, .FORTRAN or .FOR) is omitted, then COMIS will start from the
pre-compiled version in memory and not from the file. Results of a
selection can be saved in a MASK (See NTUPLE/MASK).
Example:
.
   NT/PLOT 30.X Z<0.4>>MNAME(4)
.
means mark bit 4 in mask MNAME for all events satisfying the condition Z<0.4
.
A MASK may also be given as input to a selection expression.
Example:
.
   NT/PLOT 30.X MNAME(4).and.Z<0.4
.
means all events satisfying bit 4 of MNAME AND Z<0.4
.
It is possible to plot expressions of the original variables.
Examples:
.
   NT/PLOT 30.SIN(X)%SQRT(Y**2+Z**2)  Z<0.4
.
plots a scatter-plot of variable U versus V for all events
satisfying the condition Z<0.4. U and V are defined as being
U=SIN(X) and V=SQRT(X**2+Y**2).
.
   NT/PLOT 30.func.f(X)%(SIN(Y)+3.)  Z<0.2.and.TEST.FTN>6
.
plots a scatter-plot of variable U versus V for all events
satisfying the condition (Z<0.2 and the result of the COMIS
function test.f >6). U and V are defined as being
U=(Result of the COMIS function func.f), V=(SIN(Y)+3.)
.
The default identifier of the histogram being filled is IDH=1000000.
At the next invocation of this command, it will be overwritten.
.
If either NEVENT or IFIRST or NUPD are negative, then the identifier
of the histogram being filled will be taken as IDH=-NEVENT or
IDH=-IFIRST or IDH=-NUPD. This facility is kept for backward compatibility
but it is strongly recommended to use the parameter IDH instead. 
.
IDH may have been created with H/CREATE.
Before filling IDH, the contents of IDH are reset if IDH already
exists. Use NTUPLE/PROJECT to cumulate several passes into IDH.
By default IDH value is 1000000. This means that the histogram
binning will be computed automatically. In particular the minimal
and maximal value of the histogramed quantity has to be computed which
implies to do an extra pass on the ntuple data.
IDH not equal to 1000000 is a convenient way to force user
binning.
.
Every NUPD events, the current status of the  histogram is displayed.
.
Note that IFIRST and NEVENT parameters are meaningless in case of CHAINs.

CNAME 'Chain Name' C D=' '
ENTRY 'Chain Member(s) | -P Path' C D=' ' VARARG

>Guidance
Using the chain command one can build logical Ntuples of unlimited size.
The chain command creates an Ntuple chain CNAME and add member(s) ENTRY.
If the chain already exists the member is simply added.
More than one member may be specified at a time.
A chain can contain three different type of members: files,
logical units and other chains. The member type is deduced from the format
of the member. Entries containing the characters . / : ; $ are considered
to be files, entries like //LUN4 are assumed to be logical units
and all other type of entries are chains. Chain names must be unique.
After a chain has been defined it can be traversed, by all Ntuple
commands (NT/PLOT, NT/PROJ, NT/LOOP), by changing the current working
directory to the chain: CD //CNAME.

A member may be deleted from a chain by
preceding it by a - sign. A complete chain can be deleted by preceding
the chain name by a -. All chains can be deleted by giving a - as chain
name. Not specifying any parameters results in the listing of all defined
chains. A chain tree will be printed by appending a > character to the
chain name.

The path of all chain members, from chain CNAME downwards, can be changed
by specifying a chain path. This is done by giving a chain name followed
by the -P option and a path specification. The chain path will be pre-pended
to the member names. Chains down the tree can override a path specified
higher up in the tree.
.
Examples of chain (Ntuple tree) definition:
.
 CHAIN   Year93  Jan Feb March April May ...
 CHAIN   Jan     Week1 Week2 Week3 Week4
 CHAIN   Week1   file1.hbook file2.hbook ...
 CHAIN   Week2   file3.hbook file4.hbook ...
.
 CD //Jan
 NT/PLOT 10.e     ; loop over all files in chains Week1, Week2, Week3, ...
 CD //Year93      ; loop over all files in chains Jan, Feb, March, ...
 CHAIN Year93 -P /user/delphi   ; all files from chain Year93 downward will
                                  be changed to /user/delphi/file1.hbook, ...
.
 CHAIN Year93>    ; print the chain tree Year93
 CHAIN -Feb       ; delete chain Feb
 CHAIN Jan -file3.hbook   ; delete file3.hbook from chain Jan
.
Long (around 70 characters) file names (including the path) must be avoided.
They can be misunderstood and the results produced may be wrong. A warning is 
printed, when ntuple command is executed on a chain, if the file name length 
exceed the safe value. The safe file name length is printed in the warning.
.
Note that IFIRST and NEVENT parameters are not meaningful in case of CHAINs
in the ntuple commands.

>Guidance
To generate the FORTRAN skeleton of a selection function or the
INCLUDE file with the columns declaration.
.
A FORTRAN function is generated if the FNAME is of the form,
xxx.f, xxx.for, xxx.fortran. Otherwise an INCLUDE file is generated.
Example:
If the Row Wise Ntuple ID=30 has variable names [X,Y,Z] then:
.
   NTUPLE/UWFUNC 30 SELECT.FOR   
.
will generate the file SELECT.FOR with:
.
         REAL FUNCTION SELECT()
         REAL
        +X       ,Y       ,Z

        +X       ,Y       ,Z
   *
         SELECT=1.
         END
.
Then using the command EDIT one can modify this file which could then
look something like (IDNEVT is the event number):
.
         REAL FUNCTION SELECT()
         REAL
        +X       ,Y       ,Z

   *
         IF(X**2+Y**2.GT.Z**2)THEN
            SELECT=1.
         ELSE
            SELECT=0.
         ENDIF
         END
.
   NTUPLE/UWFUNC 30 SELECT.INC 
.
will generate an include file. This include file
may be referenced in a selection function in the following way:
.
         FUNCTION SELECT()
         include 'select.inc'
   *
         SELECT=1.
         IF(X.LE.Y)SELECT=0.
         END
.
Note that the command UWFUNC is not required if the SELECT function has the
following form:
         FUNCTION SELECT()
         include ?
   *
         SELECT=1.
         IF(X.LE.Y)SELECT=0.
         END
.
In this case (thanks to the statement 'include ?') the include file will be
generated automatically with the name 'comis.inc'.
.
It is possible to add input parameters to the SELECT function and to
use them in the function's body.

Data reduction on Ntuple.
The method used is the PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS.
The Principal Components Analysis method consists in applying
a linear transformation to the original variables of a ntuple.
This transformation is described by an orthogonal matrix and
is equivalent to a rotation of the original space to a new set
of coordinates vectors, which hopefully provide easier identification
and dimensionality reduction. This matrix is real positive definite
and symmetric and has all its eigenvalues greater than zero.
Among the family of all complete orthonormal bases, the basis
formed by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix and belonging
to the largest eigenvalues corresponds to the most significant features
for the description of the original ntuple.
.
Reduction of the variables for NEVENT events starting at IFIRST
The default is to take all the 20 first variables.
.
This command creates a file: xtoxsi.f, XTOXSI.FORTRAN, xtoxsi.for or xtoxsi.ftn.
This file contains a Fortran function which computes the new variables.
These new variables can be visualised in PAW with for example:
 PAW > Ntuple/plot id.xtoxsi.ftn(1)
 PAW > Ntuple/plot id.xtoxsi.ftn(1)%xtoxsi.ftn(3)

but be sure you have enough swap space and realize that when the buffer
is swapped to disk you loose part of the benefit of the buffer facility
(which is to reduce the number of disk accesses). Omitting the argument

 METAFL=   4 Appendix E GKS.
 METAFL=-111 HIGZ/PostScript (Portrait).
 METAFL=-112 HIGZ/PostScript (Landscape).
 METAFL=-113 HIGZ/Encapsulated PostScript.
 METAFL=-114 HIGZ/PostScript Colour (Portrait).
 METAFL=-115 HIGZ/PostScript Colour (Landscape).
 METAFL=-777 HIGZ/LaTex Encapsulated.
 METAFL=-778 HIGZ/LaTex.
.
The PostScript metafile types have the following format:
.
                   -[Format][Nx][Ny][Type]
.
Where:

[Format] Is an integer between 0 and 99 which defines the format of the
paper. For example if Format=3 the paper is in the standard
A3 format. Format=4 and Format=0 are the same and
define an A4 page.
The A0 format is selected by Format=99.
The US format Letter is selected by Format=100.
The US format Legal is selected by Format=200.
The US format Ledger is selected by Format=300.
.
[Nx, Ny] Specify respectively the number of zones on the x and y axis.
Nx and Ny are integers between 1 and 9.
.
[Type] Can be equal to:
 1: Portrait mode with a small margin at the bottom of the page.

 2: Landscape mode with a small margin at the bottom of the page.

 4: Portrait mode with a large margin at the bottom of the page.

 5: Landscape mode with a large margin at the bottom of the page.
 The large margin is useful for some PostScript printers (very
 often for the colour printers) as they need more space to grip
 the paper for mechanical reasons. Note that some PostScript
 colour printers can also use the so called 'special A4' format
 permitting the full usage of the A4 area; in this case larger
 margins are not necessary and {\tt Type}=1 or 2 can be used.

 3: Encapsulated PostScript. This Type permits the generation of
 files which can be included in other documents, for example
 in LaTeX files. Note that with this Type, Nx and Ny must always
 be equal to 1, and Format has no meaning. The size of the picture
 must be specified by the user via the SIZE command. Therefore
 the workstation type for Encapsulated PostScript is -113. For
 example if the name of an encapsulated PostScript file is
 example.eps, the inclusion of this file into a LaTeX file will
 be possible via (in the LaTeX file):
.
                    \begin{figure}
                     \epsffile{example.eps}
                     \caption{Example of Encapsulated PostScript in LaTeX.}
                     \label{EXAMPLE}
                    \end{figure}
.
With Type=1,2,4 and 5 the pictures are centred on the page, and the usable
area on paper is proportional to the dimensions of A4 format.
Examples:
.
-111 or -4111 defines an A4 page not divided.
-6322 define an A6 landscape page divided in 3 columns and 2 rows.
.

.
The first picture  will be drawn  in the area 1. After each clear the screen,
the graphics output will appear in the next area in the order defined above.
If a page is filled, a new page is used with the same grid. Note that empty
pages are not printed in order to save paper.
.
Ignoring formats smaller than A12, the total number of possible different
PostScript workstation types is: 4x9x9x13+1 = 4213 !
.
Note: this command open a metafile on the workstation identifier number 2.

            NDIV=2 --> 2 divisions, one tick mark in the middle
                       of the axis.
.
Orientation of tick marks on axis: Tick marks are normally drawn
on the positive side of the axis.However, if X0=X1, then Negative .
        CHOPT='+': tick marks are drawn on Positive side. (default)
        CHOPT='-': tick marks are drawn on the negative side.
        i.e: '+-' --> tick marks are drawn on both sides of the axis.

In the following, we have some parameters, like
tick marks length and characters height (in percentage
of the length of the axis).The default values are as follows:
        Primary tick marks: 3.0 %
        Secondary tick marks: 1.5 %
        Third order tick marks: .75 %
        Characters height for labels: 2%
        Characters spacing (related to height): 40%
        Labels offset: 4.0 %
.
Type of labels: Labels are normally numeric . However, alphanumeric
labels can be drawn (see command LABEL).
        CHOPT='T':   Alphanumeric labels .
.
Intrinsic parameters: These values can be changed with the command
SET. The default value is used unless the corresponding option is
selected by CHOPT:
        CHOPT='D' The distance between the labels and the axis
                  (the offset) is given by the preceding command
                  SET with the parameter LAOF.
        CHOPT='H' The size (height) of the labels is given by the
                  preceding command SET with the parameter LASI.
        CHOPT='S' The size of the tick marks is given by the preceding
                  command SET with the parameter TMSI.

Draw an histogram defined by arrays X and Y.
The number of components needed in vectors X and/or in Y may be
dependent upon the value of CHOPT (see options 'R' and 'N').
By default if the option 'N' is not given, X(1) contains the X
minimum value and X(2) the X maximum value (the others are
ignored as the example show it).
To set Log scales in X and/or Y, use OPT LOGX/LOGY.
Note that when an option is specified, it is also necessary to
specify the options 'W' or 'HW' in order to start a new zone
or/and draw the axes.

>Guidance
Define a palette of attributes.
The palette number is used in the command SET. The command
SET HCOL 0.1 defines the palette number 1 as colour indices
used by the command LEGO in case of stacked lego plots and
plotting of SURFACE with options 1 or 2, LEGO with option 2
and CONTOUR with option 3.
.
By default the palettes are initialised with 6 elements:
2,3,4,5,6,7.
.
If the number of elements (NEL) is equal to 0 (default), the
palette is filled automatically according to the number of
colours defined with the command SET NCOL:
.
a) If NCOL is smaller or equal to 8, the palette is filled with a
subset of the 8 basic colours.
Example:
.
    PAW > SET NCOL 8        | Define the number of colours
    PAW > PALETTE 1         | The palette 1 is filled with
                            | 8 elements: 0,5,7,3,6,2,4,1
    PAW > SET NCOL 4        | Define the number of colours
    PAW > PALETTE 1         | The palette 1 is filled with
                            | 4 elements: 0,5,7,3
.
b) If NCOL is greater than 8, the palette is filled
with colours varying continuously from blue to red. This is
called a 'geographical palette'.
Example:
.
    PAW > SET NCOL 16     | Define the number of colours
    PAW > PALETTE 1       | Fill palette 1 with 8 elements
                          | (8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15) varying
                          | continuously from blue to red
.
Note that after the command SET NCOL, the colour indices from
8 to NCOL are set with gray levels. The command PALETTE 1
reset the same indices with a 'geographical palette' varying
continuously from blue to red.

cross wires
>Guidance
Draw 'cross-wires' on a picture,
optionally with tick marks and values.
Cross-wires are lines perpendicular to the X and/or Y axis.
.
The values of XVAL are always histogram coordinates.
.
The tick marks will be drawn on both side of the cross
wire, unless the cross-wires are requested on the boundary
of the box surrounding the histogram (i.e. at the extreme
limits of the drawn histogram). In this case tick marks will
only be drawn inside the box.
.
The options 'A' and 'B' (for Above and Below)
refer only to the cross-wire perpendicular to the Y axis.
In each case only one cross-wire will be drawn.
.
Similarly 'L' and 'R' (Left and Right) refer only
to the cross-wires perpendicular to the X-axis.
.
It is possible to redefine the length of tick marks on the X or Y
axis with SET XTIC or SET YTIC.
.
The position of the axis values may be changed
with SET XVAL or SET YVAL.
.
The Number of divisions can be changed with SET NDVX and SET NDVY.
.
This command combines with the command NUL is a easy way to redraw
axis on the current plot.

      COMMON /HCFITD/FITPAD(24),FITFUN 
in FUNC
.
Some plotting options available in the command HISTOGRAM/PLOT can be also used.
.
When 'NN' is given as the two first letters of the fitting model,
a Multi-Layer Perceptron like function is used to do the fit. The
syntax of the command becomes:
.
 VEC/FIT X Y EY NNi[,j] [CHOPT NEPOCH] 
.
Where: i[,j] number of neurons in the single hidden layer (if only i given) 
or in the two hidden layer if i,j are given. NEPOCH is the number of training 
epochs (default = 100).
If the option '+' is given, the network continues to minimise starting from the
previous weights. If the option 'I' is given, different random weights are used.
Thus, repeated 
.
vec/fit x y ey NN4 ! 400 
.
commands all give the same result, whereas repeated
.
vec/fit x y ey NN4 I 400.
.
commands all lead to a different result because of different initial weights.
