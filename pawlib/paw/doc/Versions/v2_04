*-- Author :    Rene Brun   28/10/93
*
*::>          VERSION  2.04/15   14/03/94 12.47.29
*
* Change $PAWSIZ for VAX to BIG
*
* Change format in PASCA1
*
* Plot commands typed in kxterm now also cause the histo style panel
* to be set accordingly. Change in $PCADDR and new $PCHIST. Decks
* PAHIST, PANTUP, PAWFCI, PAWINT2, PMINIT, HISTO changed, new deck PMHIST.
*
* Cut editor now also accepts weights (select 'W' from operator menu).
* Decks CUTEXPR, CUTS, $CUTEXPR changed.
*
* Major re-naming and re-ordering of PATCHES and DECKS. In view of CMZ's
* new include file generating capabilities. CMDES became HMOTIF. HPAW
* is now of type XCC (was DATA) and contains now also the $CHAIN sequences.
* All KEEP names were stripped of their _H (this would generate include
* files with names like analyse_h.h which is not nice). PILOT patches
* updated accordingly. Still PATCHY compatible.
*
* Fixes in layout of HistoStyle panel.
*
* New options in Ntuple viewer (profile, boxes and extended info)
* and introduction of a column selector for the scan command.
*
* Unix systems now use C I/O. Changes in PAWROP and PAZRZ.
*
* Changed the names of ANUMCH and ALPHCH to PNUMCH and PLPHCH (names were
* also used in COMIS).
*
* In PANTUP: for 2D plot 'D' option also produces scatter plot.
*
* Fix in PPROJ0 in case less events than slaves (PIAF).
*
* Bug fixed in HGETN2: for CWN ntuples, NTVARM and TTVARM was
* reset together MLOWNT and MUPNT. So the colors was not visible
* in expression like NT/PLOT 10.x%y%z%t.
*
* In PANT3D the histogram title is drawn.
*
*::>          VERSION  2.04/14   03/03/94 15.56.52
*

*
* ZEBRA routines added to PAWCS.
*     MZSTOR,MZDIV,MZLINK,MZWORK,MZBOOK,MZDROP,MZPUSH
*     MZWIPE,MZGARB,MZFORM,LZFIND,LZFID,DZSHOW,DZVERI
* HBOOK routine HDIFFB added to PAWCS
*
*::>          VERSION  2.04/13   28/02/94 18.50.06

*
* New HBOOK routine HKIND callable from PAWCS
*
* Mods in PAWFCA to allow VMS filenames satrting with SYMBOL:FILE
*
* Added an extensive logging facility for PIAF. The logging system uses
* the BSD syslog facilty to spool the log info to a single file in the
* cluster. The syslogd needs to be configured to relay messages to the
* logging facilities LOCAL6 (piafserv) and LOCAL7 (piafslave).
*
* New deck PIAFL in patch PIAFS with the logging routines.
* New deck $PIAF contains C include.

*
* Mods in PAWCS to call the "HFILL fast replacement" via CSHEXT.
*
* The file .piafrc is not created automatically anymore. Changes in
* TCPIAF and PIAFRONT. Depending on the protocol level flag IPROTO
* PIAFRONT and PIAFSERV know how to treat the passwd information.
*

*  coordinates. See HELP LOCATE.

*
* Implemented .f77 (using the Fortran compiler) for PIAF.
* Routines changed: PAWFCA, PCINFO, PFCSEX, PSEXEC, and a few others.
