To run the testsuite do

% runtest --tool paw 

A specific paw-exe can be specified

% runtest --tool paw PAW=$HOME/pawX11.special

The tests can be run without a window on the screen by

% runtest --tool paw PAW_BATCH=1

The tests can be run with a longer timeout
( e.g for purify use 120 seconds )

% runtest --tool paw PAW_TIMEOUT=120

To look at the graphics on the screen you can switch
on the PAW pto option by 

% runtest --tool paw PAW_PTO=

You can run a specific test by giving the name
of the test ( the test still should be in a directory
starting with "paw." )

% runtest --tool paw my_test.exp

For full info do 'man runtest' or look at the info pages.
