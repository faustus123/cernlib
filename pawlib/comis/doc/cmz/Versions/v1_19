******DECK,V1_18.
******::>          VERSION  1.18/14   18/01/95 14.25.56
*
*     Several improvements in COMIS-translater have been made:
*      - restrictions on order of type declarations are removed;
*      - BLOCK DATA statement is allowed;
*      - Implied length arrays are allowed.
*
*     Some modifications have been made to support dynamicaly
*     arguments type checking in PAW-COMIS interface:
*      - Extensions to CSEXT to specify the type and dimensions
*        of arguments
*   name [.type] [( type [ ( [dim,...,dim] ) ] , ... )] , ...
*
*   type -> i | r | c*inumber | l | d | [se] | x
*   dim  -> inumder | *
*
* ex: 'cstypar.s(int,int,char*1,int,int,int(7),int)#'
*
*       - New subroutine added
*        CSTYPAR (IADDR,IPAR,TYPE,ISIZE,NVDIM,IVDIM,IERR)
*
*::>          VERSION  1.18/13   18/10/94 11.12.02
*
*     Changes to support the case of a routine calling other routines
*     for dynamic compilation and linking.  (this was a fatal error)
*

*
*     Include directives can be nested.
*
*     Changes in CSLISTX routine, additional argument IADDR
*           CALL CSLISTX(cbname,iaddr,ioffs,nel)
*
*     New integer function CSLISTC(IADDR,NEXT)
*     for given routine with address IADDR returns address of
*     called routines.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.18/10   15/09/94 18.48.37
*
*    Mods for cscrexec, csrmsl routines.

*
*     Dynamic linking for SGIs, select the flag SHL, use f77 options

*
*     Changes in: CSTRAN, CSCTLI and CSDVLN.
*     A user reported a problem with the following selection function JETS
*     When we call CSLISTX, you return correctly the following variables
*     OBJECT,COUNT,NUMBER,PX,X13. But you also return an additional variable
*     at offset 49 (X13 is returned correctly at offset 41) and NEL=1550.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.18/07   14/07/94 14.13.37
*
*     Modify CSINCL to support INCLUDE ? for PAW ntuples
*
*     Modify CSRD and CSF77 for INCLUDE ?
*
*     When INCLUDE ? is given, COMIS will call the PAW routine PAWUWF
*     to get the ntuple definition to be written on local file COMIS.INC
*
*::>          VERSION  1.18/06   07/07/94 15.04.28

*
*     New routine added CSRMSL(NAME) to unload shl with name
*        CHPATH//NAME//'.sl'
*
*     Treatment of CALL HFILL(.....) added
*
*     The format I edit descriptor can be "Iw.m"
*
*     New rules for file extentions:
*       file...77, file.c file.sl file.csl
*
*     New directive "!SET ['string' what]"  added to fullfil
*     SHLOPTions
*     !SET     shows current values
*     New release of CSPDIR routine
*
*     New version of CSLISTX routine introduced
*
*     New flag WINNT added,
* seq: +SELF,IF=SGI,IBMRT,DECS,HPUX,SUN,MSDOS.  replaced by
*      +SELF,IF=UNIX,IF=STDUNIX.
*
* seq: +SELF,IF=UNIX,IF=-SGI,IF=-IBMRT,IF=-DECS,IF=-HPUX,IF=-SUN,IF=-MSDOS.
* repl by  +SELF,IF=UNIX,IF=-STDUNIX.
*
*      Now it is possible to call a function without args.
*         i.e.   r=fun0()
*
*      Routine CSFRES replaced by CSLFRE
*
*     If file name ended with .sl for the time being just
*     shl-library name loaded
*
*     New routine added CSHLOPT(string,what)
*     if what=
*           'path' CHPATH=string
*           'f77'  CHF77 =string
*           'cc'   CHCC  =string
*
*     1) cscrsl now creates all needed files in CWD
*     2) if file name ended with .c cc compiler invokes
*     3) if shl containts unresolved symbols it does not load
*
