*::>          VERSION  1.09/04   26/10/93 10.02.36
*
*
*::>          VERSION  1.09/03   28/09/93 14.21.40
*
* New operators:
*
*  INV   Matrix inversion
*
*  DET   Matrix determinant
*
*  Routines F010 and F011 from CERN Program Library are used
*
*  Error messages are produced if:
*
*  - the matrix is singular
*
*  - the determinant is (felt to be) too large or too small.
*
*  The error messages are produced according to the F010 and F011
*  routines specifications.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.09/02   19/08/93 14.43.47
*
* New routines as listed below protected against ill-defined values
* Unused labels of END statements removed (causing the ALPHA
* compiler to complian with a misleading message.
* _ (underscore) is now allowed to appear in names.
* NOT AS LAST CHARACTER OF COURSE!
* Revision of error messages (now clearer)
*
*
*::>          VERSION  1.09/01   05/08/93 15.39.31
*
*  Variable IMOD renamed to JMOD in several routines. This change
*  was required in order to compile SIGMA on SGI systems.
*
*  EQUIVALENCE statements moved before DATA in routine SIDELI
