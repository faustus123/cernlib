\section{Introduction\label{INTRO}}

      ISAJET is a Monte Carlo program which simulates $pp$, 
$\bar pp$ and $e^+e^-$ interactions at high energies. 
ISAJET is based on
perturbative QCD plus phenomenological models for parton and beam jet
fragmentation. Events are generated in four distinct steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item A primary hard scattering is generated according to the
appropriate QCD cross section.
\item QCD radiative corrections are added for both the initial and the
final state.
\item Partons are fragmented into hadrons independently, and particles
with lifetimes less than about $10^{-12}$ seconds are decayed.
\item Beam jets are added assuming that these are identical to a
minimum bias event at the remaining energy.
\end{itemize}

      ISAJET incorporates ISASUSY, which evaluates branching ratios for
the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model. H.~Baer and
X.~Tata are coauthors of this package, and they have done the original
calculations with various collaborators. See the ISASUSY documentation
in the patch Section~\ref{SUSY}.

      ISAJET is supported for ANSI Fortran and for Cray, DEC Ultrix,
DEC VMS, HP/9000 7xx, IBM VM/CMS 370 and 30xx, IBM AIX RS/6000, Linux,
Silicon Graphics 4D, and Sun computers. The CDC 7600 and ETA 10
versions are obsolete and are no longer supported. It is written
mainly in ANSI standard FORTRAN 77, but it does contain some
extensions except in the ANSI version. The code is maintained with a
combination of RCS, the Revision Control System, and the Patchy code
management system, which is part of the CERN Library. The original
sources are kept on physgi01.phy.bnl.gov in
\verb|~isajet/isalibrary/RCS|; decks revised in release \verb|n.nn|
are kept in \verb|~isajet/isalibrary/nnn|. ISAJET is supplied to BNL,
CERN, Fermilab, and SLAC; it is also available by anonymous ftp from
\begin{verbatim}
ftp://penguin.phy.bnl.gov/pub/isajet
\end{verbatim}
or by request from the authors.

      Patch ISAPLT contains the skeleton of an HBOOK histogramming
job, a trivial calorimeter simulation, and a jet-finding algorithm.
(The default is HBOOK4; HBOOK3 can be selected with a Patchy switch.)
These are provided for convenience only and are not supported.
