C.
C.    Eurodec is a general purpose Monte Carlo program for the
C.    fragmentation and decay of quarks, di-quarks, heavy leptons etc.
C.    It can be attached to the event generators:
C.
C.       EUROJET - EUROPPB, Event generator for pp(bar) interactions,
C.               - EUREPEM, Event generator for e+e- interactions,
C.               - EUROEP,  Event generator for e-p interactions,
C.               - Your own event generator.
C.
C.    The routine FRAGMT provides the steering of this program. The I/0
C.    follows through the common blocks /MOMGEN/ (input) and /RESULT/
C.    (input/output). 'NTEIL' is the number of particles already
C.    entered into /RESULT/ (the user should initialize 'NTEIL' !). New
C.    particles will be added starting from position 'NTEIL+1'. The
C.    arguments of the steering routine 'FRAGMT' the user has to
C.    provide (only when it is used as a stand-alone program) read:
C.
C.    IP1    = pointer to first particle in the common /MOMGEN/,
C.    IP2    = pointer to last particle in the common /MOMGEN/ to be
C.             treated for fragmentation,
C.    NTEIL0 = particles from position NTEIL0+1 onwards will be used in
C.             the energy/momentum conservation procedure. Except for
C.             the treatement of the underlying event in hadronic
C.             interactions, NTEIL0 will generally be equal to NTEIL.
C.
C.    The other commons are needed for control and/or
C.    initialization parameters (See Subroutine EUDCIN!).
C.    Before the first call to the steering routine is made the user
C.    should have made a call to the initialization package (EUDINI).
