Description:
   STDHEP contains a set of translation routines which convert
   Herwig, Jetset, Isajet, or QQ events to and from the standard
   HEP event format.  STDHEP also contains utility routines
   to work with the HEPEVT common block and a set of I/O routines.
   The HEPEVT common block allows 4000 particles per event.

   The translation of Xi_c and Xi_b particles has changed with version
   2.01.  Also, the read/write routines changed with version 2.01.  
   A bug was found in the 2.x read/write routines.  That bug was
   fixed in version 3.00.  Please use stdrepair on old I/O files.
   This version is not backwards compatible.

   Mcfio, an xdr I/O interface package, is included with stdhep.
   As of version 3.01, c bindings of the mcfio interface routines
   are available from libstdhepC.a.
