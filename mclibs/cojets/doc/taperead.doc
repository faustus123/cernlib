[15] TAPE READING (FOR IOISA OUTPUT)

      The output tape from COJETS can be read with the routines contained
in patch COJTAPER. In order to use them, one must also use patch COJCDE,
deck COJVER in patch COJDATA, and decks AMASS, CHARGE, LABEL, INTID, MOVLEV
in patch COJETS. Differently from ISAJET, one must not read again the
particle-decay table, whose content is included in the beginning record of
the event tape, together with the other program parameters.

      The pilot patch *COJPLT can be used to select all the routines
necessary for tape reading, [5]. It also selects the routines of the sample
program COJPLT, which reads the output tape and makes some histogramming
(see below). In order to avoid selection of the latter it is sufficient to
eliminate the +USE,COJPLT card from it.

      The FORTRAN instruction
      CALL RDTAPE(IDEV,IFL)
will read a beginning record, an end record or an event (which can be
more than one record). IDEV is the tape number and
      IFL=0  for a good read,
      IFL=-1 for an end of file.
The information is restored to the common blocks described above. The
type of record is contained in

#include "cojets/rectp.inc"
IRECTP            =100 for an event record
IRECTP            =200 for a beginning record
IRECTP            =300 for an end record
IREC              =no. of physical records in event record, 0 otherwise

      All the information listed in [14] (OUTPUT TAPE) is available.

      The weight per event needed to produce a weighted histogram in millibarn
units is SIGF/NEVENT. The integrated cross section SIGF corresponds to the
given kinematic limits (PTFFFM and PTFFFX for TWOJET, QMIN and QMAX for QED
DRELLYAN), to the selected decay mode for DRELLYAN, and to the possible
forcing of the production of heavy quarks and of their semileptonic decays.
It does NOT include the effects of FORCE. But it INCLUDES
the effects of event editing done by the user through function EDIT.
For lack of time, the job might have terminated before generating the
requested number of events, NEVENT. NEVTAP always reports the actual number
of events written on tape. Thus it is safer to use SIGF/NEVTAP as event
weight rather than SIGF/NEVENT.
      The value of SIGF can be obtained by reading through the tape until
an end record (IRECTP=300) is found. It can be used at the end of histogram
calculations for their normalization.

      The functions AMASS(IDENT), CHARGE(IDENT), and LABEL(IDENT) are
available to determine the mass, charge, and character*8 LABEL of particle
with code IDENT. CALL PRTEVT(0) prints an event.

        A sample program reading the output tape and making some
histogramming with the package HBOOK of the CERN Program Library is
contained in patch COJPLT. In order to use it one must make the
following steps.

  i)  Get the appropriate FORTRAN ASM file by running YPATCHY with the
      *COJPLT pilot patch, [5].

 ii)  Set up a MAIN program containing at least the following:

      PROGRAM MAIN
C
C          MAIN PROGRAM FOR COJPLT
C          TAPE NUMBERS ARE ARBITRARY
C
C          FILES TO BE CONNECTED INTERNALLY, WITH OPEN STATEMENTS,
C          OR EXTERNALLY
C
      CALL COJPLT(i,j)
C
      STOP
      END

      The arguments of COJPLT are tape numbers for files, all of which
should be opened by the main program (or assigned externally).
      TAPEi: unit number of tape with the events.
      TAPEj: output list unit.

iii)  Link the CERN Program Library, in order to use HBOOK.

      Patch COJPLT can be modified by the user to suit its needs. In line
comment cards show where standard replacements should be made.
