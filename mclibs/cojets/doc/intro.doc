[1] INTRODUCTION

      COJETS is a Monte Carlo program which simulates pbar-p and p-p
interactions at high energy. The interaction process is first calculated at
the parton level by means of perturbative QCD and the Weinberg-Salam model for
electro-weak interactions. Partons are then independently fragmented into jets
of hadrons, according to the Field-Feynman  model, and the beam jets
contribution is added, according to a longitudinal phase-space model. Multiple
QCD radiation off initial and final partons is included.

      The following processes are simulated:

i) purely hadronic production, including particles with charm, bottom and top;

ii) weak Drell-Yan production of the W and Z vector bosons;

iii) electromagnetic Drell-Yan production of charged lepton pairs.

      In leptonic decays of the W and Z bosons multiple QED radiation effects
are calculated. Decays of top particles are treated for an arbitrary top quark
mass, with multiple QCD radiation effects for decay jets and multiple QED
radiation for decay leptons included.

      COJETS is written in FORTRAN 77. It is maintained with the PATCHY code
management system, which is part of the CERN Program Library. It is supported
for CRAY, IBM and VAX machines. It is available on request from the author.
