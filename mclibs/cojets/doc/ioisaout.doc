[14] OUTPUT TAPE FOR IOISA

      The output tape or file contains three types of records. Three
beginning records are written by a call to WRBEG before generating a set
of events; an event record is written by a call to WRTAPE for each
event; and an end record is written for each run by a call to WREND.
These subroutines load the common blocks described below into a single
COMMON/ZEVEL/ZEVEL(1024) and write it out when it is full. A subroutine
RDTAPE, described in the next section, inverts this process so that the
user can analyse the event. The user may select the events to be written
on tape appropriately setting the logical function EDIT.

      ZEVEL is written out to TAPEj by a call to BUFOUT. ZEVEL is written
out with a standard FORTRAN unformatted write.

      The user can replace subroutines WRBEG, WRTAPE, and WREND to
write out the events in a different format. The user can change the tape
record format by modifying subroutine BUFOUT (and correspondingly BUFIN
when reading the tape). The present write/read statementes have been chosen
for portability. They can be optimized using machine dependent extensions,
like asynchronous write/read on the CRAY. On IBM and VAX, one can adopt
variable length binary records and write ZEVEL only up to its highest IL
entry, which is actually used. For this sake, the present write statement
in BUFOUT should be replaced with

      WRITE(ITA) (ZEVEL(I),I=1,IL)

and the present read statement in BUFIN with

      READ(ITB,ERR=100,END=200) (IZVL1,IZVL2,(ZEVEL(JJ),JJ=3,IZVL2))

Because of the variety of options, including a number of packing algorithms,
it has been preferred to leave further write/read specifications to the
user.

      Units are GeV for energy and momentum, radians for angles, and
millibarns for the cross section. The positive z axis is defined by the
initial antiproton direction.

writes out the following common blocks (only the listed entries):

      In QED radiative leptonic decays of Drell-Yan produced Z/W/GAMMA, the
coding of the decay in the /PARTCL/ particle stream goes through two steps:
  i) the decay of the boson into two leptons, as from the decay table, which
     are off the mass shell if undergoing radiation;
 ii) the decay of the charged lepton(s), off the mass shell, into photons
     and final lepton(s), on the mass shell.
      If there are two charged lepton secondaries, photons are aggregated
to the final charged lepton closer in angle, when calculating the off-shell
mass of primary leptons. If a charged lepton does not radiate, it appears
in the first step only.
      If only stable particles are retained, information about the lepton
of origin of the decay products is retained in IORIG, through the JET
parameter.

      In top particle decays, there are jets among the secondaries. The
decay history can be coded in two alternative ways, according to the TOPFORM
card. One of them follows the specifications of ISAJET: parton information
is disregarded, the decay history appears only in the particle stream and
follows the usual rules for particle decays (the IDCAY of primary top decay
partons identifies all primary particles generated in the fragmentation of
all the jets originated by the parton). The other one includes information
about the decay parton development. With it the coding of the decay history
follows two paths, within the particle and the parton streams, as specified
in the following.
      If unstable particles are retained, the two paths cross each other.
The origin of the decaying top particle can be traced back to the top jet of
origin, through IORIG in the particle cascade. (The JDCAY of the final top
jet in the parton cascade is set to 0.). When the top particle decays, the
decay coding goes through two steps:
  i) the decay of the top particle into the 3 primary leptons/partons, as
     from the decay table;
 ii) the radiative decays of the primary charged leptons and the jet
     developments of the partons.
      Primary decay leptons which do not decay radiatively appear only
once, in the first step. If they radiate, the decay coding parallels the
one used for leptonic decays of Drell-Yan produced Z/W/GAMMA.
      Primary decay partons appear both in /PARTCL/, coded as particles, and
in /JETSET/ coded as jets. Their IORIG's in /PARTCL/ give the top particle
as origin. Their JORIG's in /JETSET/ give the corresponding partons in
/PARTCL/ as origins. A negative sign in front of their JORIG's signals that
they do not result from a parton cascade, but from the decay of a particle.
The IORIG's of primary particles in a decay jet gives the jet in /JETSET/
as their origin, according to the general convention. Thus, when following
the genealogy of a stable particle in a decay jet backwards, one moves
in general through the following steps:
  i) first, a cascade of unstable particles belonging to the jet, up to a
     primary jet particle whose origin is a jet in /JETSET/,
 ii) then, a QCD jet cascade coded in /JETSET/, up to a primary jet whose
     origin is a parton coded as particle in /PARTCL/,
iii) finally, the decaying top particle.
      The IDCAY of the top particle identifies the 3 primary decay products
in the particle stream. The IDCAY's of the latter identify the primary
particles resulting from their respective decays or jet developments.
For a parton, that means all primary particles generated in the fragmentation
of all the jets originated by the parton. Thus, following the particles
genealogy forward, by means of IDCAY, provides a description limited to the
particle stream. (Having IDCAY referring to the particle stream only is a
necessary consequence of having JDCAY referring to jets only, with JDCAY=0
characterizing a final jet in the QCD shower.)
      If stable particles only are retained, top decay particles and jets
have their origins modified, so as to jump over the missing unstable
particles, which include also the decaying top particle. Thus, the JORIG's
of primary decay jets give the top jet, to which the decaying top particle
belongs, as their origin. The IORIG's of particles generated in decay jets
give the jet in /JETSET/, to which the particles belong, as their origin. In
both cases, a minus sign is put in front.

      Events within a given run have uniform weight. Separate runs can
be combined together using SIGF/NEVENT as the weight per event. This
gives a true cross section in mb units.
