[16] PARTICLE AND DECAY TABLE, IDENT CODES FOR PARTICLES

      COJETS uses an external table for particles and decay modes. It is
contained in PATCH COJTABLE. (Differently from ISAJET where particle data
are specified internally in the program.). Its content has been taken
from ISAJET 6.00.

      The particle table should not be altered, apart from mass values and
particle LABELs. Mass values of Z and W bosons and hadrons left blank or
zero are set internally: i) Z and W masses to their Weinberg-Salam values,
depending on sin(THw), with the W mass corrected by a 1/sqrt(.9304) factor
(Marciano and Sirlin), ii) hadron masses to the sum of their quark masses
corrected by  a term (-.03+.04*JSPIN), with JSPIN=0/1 for pseudoscalar/vector
mesons and spin (1/2)/(3/2) baryons.

      The IDENT particle code of ISAJET is used. Quarks and leptons are
numbered in order of mass:
         UP     = 1             NUE    = 11
         DN     = 2             E-     = 12
         ST     = 3             NUM    = 13
         CH     = 4             MU-    = 14
         BT     = 5             NUT    = 15
         TP     = 6             TAU-   = 16
with a negative sign for antiparticles. Arbitrary conventions are:
         GL     = 9
         GM     = 10
         KS     = 20
         KL     =-20
         W+     = 80
         Z0     = 90
The code for a meson is a compound integer +-JKL, where J.LE.K are the
quarks and L is the spin. The sign is for the J quark. Flavor singlet
mesons are ordered by mass,
         PI0    = 110
         ETA    = 220
         ETAP   = 330
         ETAC   = 440
Similarly, the code for a baryon is a compound integer +-IJKL formed from
the three quarks I,J,K and a spin LABEL L=0,1. The code for a diquark is
+-IJ00

      The complete list of ident codes is in PATCH COJTABLE.

      Internal particle id's, used within the program (for efficient data
packing) or optionally by the user with IOCON, are listed in the
particle-decay table printed by the program.

      The decay table can be arranged with decay particles put into the
table in arbitrary order, but all modes for each particle  must be grouped
together. The table is rewound and read in before each  run with a READ*
format. Each entry must have the form

IDENT,ITYPE,CBR,ID1,ID2,ID3,ID4,ID5/

where IDENT is the code for the parent particle, ITYPE specifies the
type of decay (it is never used in the program),
      ITYPE=1 for strong,
      ITYPE=2 for electromagnetic,
      ITYPE=3 for weak,
CBR is the cumulative branching ratio, and ID1,...,ID5 are the IDENT
codes for the decay products. The parent IDENT must be positive; the
charge conjugate mode is used for the antiparticle. The values of CBR
must of course be positive and monotonically increasing for each mode,
with the last value being 1.00 for each parent IDENT. The last parent
IDENT code must be zero. Care should be taken in adding new modes,
since there is no checking for validity.

      The order of decay secondaries is irrelevant, if the decay distribution
is determined by pure phase-space. Otherwise order may be important.

      For decays governed by V-A matrix elements, secondaries originated by
the decay of the virtual W should appear first. They are internally reordered
so that the V-A matrix element is entered properly. The final order can be
checked by having the particle-decay table printed by the program. The V-A
matrix element is taken as (PP,P2)*(P1,P3) , where PP is the 4-momentum of the
parent, P1, P2, P3 are the 4-momenta of the three ordered secondaries, and
( , ) denotes the scalar product.

      The number of quarks/diquarks in a particle decay must comply with the
model treatment of such decay modes. For decays of particles WITHOUT TOP, a
decay model can be optionally used which recombines a quark with an
antiquark or a diquark, thus the number of quarks must be equal to the number
of antiquarks and diquarks, for a maximum number of 2 quarks. For decays of
particles WITH TOP, a jet development model is used, with formation of a
Breit-Wigner shaped virtual W as an intermediate step. In this case, the total
number of secondaries must be three. The first two represent the lepton pair
or the quark-antiquark pair originated by the virtual W, and the last one is
an antiquark or a diquark, for meson and baryon decays, respectively.

      Examples of decay table entries with quark/diquark secondaries for
particles without top:

1)    SB --> E+ + NUE + st + cb

in the table should be set as

      350,   3,   (cbr),   -12,   11,   3,   -4,   0/

2)    SB --> up + db + st + cb

in the table should be set as

      350,   3,   (cbr),     1,   -2,   3,   -4,   0/

3)    DUB --> E- + ANUE + dn-up + ch

in the table should be set as

      2150,   3,   (cbr),   12,   -11,   1200,   4,   0/

4)    DUB --> dn + ub + dn-up + ch

in the table should be set as

      2150,   3,   (cbr),    2,    -1,   1200,   4,   0/

      A bug present in the ISAJET 6.00 table has been eliminated: top baryons
coded 3160 and 3260, which were left undecayed, are assigned decay modes
similar to those of other top baryons. For semileptonic decays, the relative
order of the two leptons in the table does not satisfy any fixed criterion.
That led to several errors when applying the V-A matrix element in ISAJET
5.00, which have been corrected by inserting program modifications in ISAJET
6.00. We have preferred to leave the decay table in its original form, and
to cope with the vagaries of the lepton pair order in the program, as
indicated above.
