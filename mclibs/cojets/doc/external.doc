[6] EXTERNAL ROUTINES USED BY COJETS

      COJETS needs a few external routines. They are all part of the CERN
Program Library. Here are given details about them.


FUNCTION RANF()            Uniform random number generator between 0 and 1.
                           It is called only in FUNCTION CJRN(A).

SUBROUTINE TIMEL(T)        T is the time left for execution, in seconds. It
                           is called only in SUBROUTINE TIMELF(TLEFT). It is
                           essentially used for protection against exceeding
                           the preset time limit. It can be mocked by
                           returning T with a very high value.

SUBROUTINE DATIMH(ND,NT)   ND and NT return the year-month-day and the
                           hour-minute-second, respectively, of job
                           submission, in hollerith with length 6. They are
                           scalars for 64 (or higher) bit machines, and
                           arrays of length 2 for 32 bit machines. It is
                           called only in SUBROUTINE IDGEN, to generate the
                           run identification number. It can be mocked by
                           returning ND and NT with arbitrary hollerith
                           values.

FUNCTION GAMMA(X)          Gamma function. If not available, one can +USE
                           PATCH GAMMA which contains a FORTRAN coded
                           version of it.


      Because of the variety of random number generators in use, it has
been avoided in COJETS to have explicit reference to seed setting and seed
getting operations for the random number generator. The relevant routine
calls can be easily made by the user in the main program, before and after
calling the event generator.
