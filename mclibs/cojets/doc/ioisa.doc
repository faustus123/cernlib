[11] USAGE WITH THE ISAJET TYPE I/O INTERFACE (IOISA)

      This interface parallels as much as possible the I/O interface of
ISAJET.

      COJETS is steered by a MAIN program, which contains a call to COJETS
in which tape units and other options are specified. Input is from data
cards. Output is on tape.

      To set up a job with the ISAJET type I/O interface, the user must
make the following steps. Details about them can be found in the quoted
sections.

  i)  Get the FORTRAN ASM file for COJETS by running YPATCHY with the
      *COJETS pilot patch.

 ii)  Set up a MAIN program, containing the call to COJETS, [12].

iii)  Link the CERN Program Library, or substitutes for it, [6].

 iv)  Set up the input cards, [13].

  v)  Make the particle-decay table file available to the program for
      reading, [5,16].


      Sample sets of input cards are listed in [13].

      The output tape can be read by using the routines contained in patch
COJTAPER. A sample program reading the output tape and making some
histogramming with the package HBOOK of the CERN Program Library is
contained in patch COJPLT. In order to use it one must make the
following steps. Details can be found in section [15].

  i)  Get the appropriate FORTRAN ASM file by running YPATCHY with the
      *COJPLT pilot patch, [5].

 ii)  Set up a MAIN program containing the call:
      CALL COJPLT(i,j)
      where i is the unit number of the tape with the events, and j is the
      output list unit.

iii)  Link the CERN Program Library, in order to use HBOOK.
