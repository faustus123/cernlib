      The functions AMASS(IDENT), CHARGE(IDENT), and LABEL(IDENT) are

      The function IDEXT(IDINT) converts internal parton/particle codes to
external IDENT codes.

      CALL DUMPEV causes the current event to be printed, with stable
particles only if this option has been chosen.

      In QED radiative leptonic decays of Drell-Yan produced Z/W/GAMMA, the
coding of the decay in the /EVENT/ particle stream goes through two steps:
  i) the decay of the boson into two leptons, as from the decay table, which
      are off the mass shell if undergoing radiation;
 ii) the decay of the charged lepton(s), off the mass shell, into photons
     and final lepton(s), on the mass shell.
      If there are two charged lepton secondaries, photons are aggregated
to the final charged lepton closer in angle, when calculating the off-shell
mass of primary leptons. If a charged lepton does not radiate, it appears
in the first step only.
      If only stable particles are retained, information about the lepton
of origin of the decay products is retained in IORIG, through the JET
parameter, and in PARHAD(I,7).

      In top particle decays, there are jets among the secondaries. The
coding of the decay follows two paths: the jet cascade and the particle
cascade.
      If unstable particles are retained, the two paths cross each other.
The origin of the decaying top particle can be traced back to the top jet of
origin, through IORIG in the particle cascade. (The JDCAY of the final top
jet in the parton cascade is set to 0.). When the top particle decays, the
decay coding goes through two steps:
  i) the decay of the top particle into the 3 primary leptons/partons, as
     from the decay table;
 ii) the radiative decays of the primary charged leptons and the jet
     developments of the partons.
      Primary decay leptons which do not decay radiatively appear only
once, in the first step. If they radiate, the decay coding parallels the
one used for leptonic decays of Drell-Yan produced Z/W/GAMMA.
      Primary decay partons appear both in /EVENT/, coded as particles, and
in /JETSET/ coded as jets. Their IORIG's in /EVENT/ give the top particle
as origin. Their JORIG's in /JETSET/ give the corresponding partons in
/EVENT/ as origins. A negative sign in front of their JORIG's signals that
they do not result from a parton cascade, but from the decay of a particle.
The IORIG's of primary particles in a decay jet gives the jet in /JETSET/
as their origin, according to the general convention. Thus, when following
the genealogy of a stable particle in a decay jet backwards, one moves
in general through the following steps:
  i) first, a cascade of unstable particles belonging to the jet, up to a
     primary jet particle whose origin is a jet in /JETSET/,
 ii) then, a QCD jet cascade coded in /JETSET/, up to a primary jet whose
     origin is a parton coded as particle in /EVENT/,
iii) finally, the decaying top particle.
      The IDCAY of the top particle identifies the 3 primary decay products
in the particle stream. The IDCAY's of the latter identify the primary
particles resulting from their respective decays or jet developments.
For a parton, that means all primary particles generated by all the jets
originated by the parton. Thus, following the particles genealogy forward,
by means of IDCAY, provides a description limited to the particle stream.
(Having IDCAY referring to the particle stream only is a necessary
consequence of having JDCAY referring to jets only, with JDCAY=0
characterizing a final jet in the QCD shower.)
      If stable particles only are retained, top decay particles and jets
have their origins modified, so as to jump over the missing unstable
particles, which include also the decaying top particle. Thus, the JORIG's
of primary decay jets give the top jet, to which the decaying top particle
belongs, as their origins. The IORIG's of particles generated in decay jets
give the jet in /JETSET/, to which the particles belong, as their origin. In
both cases, a minus sign is put in front.
