[13] INPUT FOR IOISA

      COJETS is controlled by commands read from the specified input
file by subroutine READIN. Syntax errors will generate a message and stop
execution. A job must consist of a single reaction run.
      The required input format is:

Title
Ecm,Nevent,Nprint,Njump/
Reaction
(Optional parameters)
STOP

with all cards starting in column 1 and typed in UPPER case. These
cards are explained below.

      Title card: Up to 80 characters long.

      Ecm card: This card must always be given. It must give the center of
mass energy (Ecm) and the number of events (Nevent) to be generated. One may
also specify the number of events to be printed (Nprint) and the increment
(Njump) for printing. The first event is always printed if Nprint.gt.0.
      For example:
630.,1000,10,100/
generates 1000 events at Ecm=630 GeV and prints 10 events. The events
printed are: 1,100,200,.... Note that an event typically takes several
pages of output. This card is read with a list directed format (READ*).

      Reaction card: This card must be always given. It selects the type
of events to be generated. The present version can generate TWOJET,
DRELLYAN, MINBIAS events. This card is read with an A8 format.

      Optional parameters: Each optional parameter requires two cards.
The first card is a keyword specifying the parameter and the second
card gives the values for the parameter. The parameters can be given in
any order, except where explicitly indicated. All values are read with a
list directed format (READ*). Character input must be enclosed in quotes.
All momenta are in GeV.

      The parameters can be classified in several groups:

Limits    DY boson  Subproc.  Decays    Other     Constants J-fragm.  Beam jets

                               decay modes it is automatically set to the
                               value of the decay threshold.
                               Default: Mass(Z/W) - 4.*Width(Z/W).

WZOPTION                       Selects option for Z/W production.
kywopt          1              1 : Z/W is produced with Breit-Wigner
                                   dependence.
                               0 : Z/W is produced in the narrow width
                                   approximation (no Breit-Wigner in the
                                   production process). A Breit-Wigner
                                   distribution is faked in the decay
                                   process.
                               Option 1 is automatically activated if:
                               i)  IDECBO = 12 and M(Z) < 2.*m(tp)+2.;
                               ii) IDECBO = 6  and M(W) < m(tp)+m(bt)+2. .
                               Option 0 is more efficient, but is inadequate
                               for a quantitative study of effects from the
                               Breit-Wigner distribution. In particular, it
                               is inadequate when selecting top decay modes
                               with a top quark mass yielding a decay
                               threshold close or above the Z/W mass.
                               When WTYPE is selected as 'GM', option 1 includes
                               GM-Z interference, option 0 is limited to the
                               virtual GM only.


      For example the cards:
PTFFF
50.,100.
would set limits for PTFFF between 50. and 100. GeV.
As another example the cards:
WTYPE
'W'
would specify that DRELLYAN events with an intermediate W boson will be
generated.
If not all entries are specified, the remaining ones are left to their
default values. Thus the cards:
PTFFF
50.,,
will fix only the lower limit for PTFFF, and will leave its upper limit to
the default value (ECM/2).

      COJETS has no efficiency problems in generating over a wide kinematic
range. Therefore, apart from the parton pt lower limit (controlled by PTFFFM),
no machinery has been set up to limit the kinematic region of generation.
The practical problem of forcing generation of statistically unfavored
events has been treated for TWOJET in the following cases: i) parton pt
forcing, ii) forcing of heavy flavor production, iii) forcing of semileptonic
decays of heavy flavor particles.
      i) Parton pt forcing. The role of PTFFFM is obvious. Usage of PTFFFX
is meant for supplementary, corrective runs. E.g., it may turn out that for
a specific event selection, like events with a muon above some pt value,
the events generated with a first run have a PTFFF distribution that appears
abruptly truncated at PTFFFM. That indicates that also lower PTFFF's should
have contributed to the same sample. Without throwing away the biased event
sample, one can integrate it with a second run where PTFFFM is set to a lower,
safe value and PTFFFX is set to PTFFFM value of the first run, thus
avoiding double counting. The two event samples will be weighted by the
corresponding SIGF/NEVENT ratios.
      ii) Forcing of heavy flavor production. One can choose between a
forcing comprehensive of fusion, flavor excitation and gluon splitting
(HEAVYQRK), or select the fusion (FUSION), flavor excitation (FLAVEX) and
gluon splitting (GSPLIT) mechanisms separately. The latter option is to be
preferred for accurate X-section determinations. When activating
HEAVYQRK one can monitor the relative importance of the three mechanisms
by sorting events using the ISIGS (/JETPAR/) parameter. At a pt small
with respect to the heavy quark mass, superimposing the three mechanisms
leads to multiple counting. At such small pt's one is supposed to employ a
full O(alphas**3) approximation, which is not yet available in exclusive form
(the results of Nason et al. (1987), cover only the total and the single
inclusive cross section). A reasonable sustitute for it is the O(alphas**2)
approximation represented by the fusion process.
      iii) Forcing of semileptonic decays of heavy flavor particles, by
means of FORCESL. Although the X-section is corrected for the decay forcing
by taking into account the appropriate branching ratios, one should not
forget the bias associated with the choice of the particles to force in the
event. The selection is done according to the pt of the originating quark
jet, particles belonging to the highest pt jets being selected. That can
introduce a negligible bias when studying, e.g., decay leptons at very high
pt. But of course it is not appropriate for studying leptons at small or
moderate pt, since it leads to an underestimation of the contribution from
events where the leptons are originated by heavy quarks with smaller pt.

      When FUSION is forced, in order to calculate the X-section including
all pt's, some changes for the QCD evolution variable are necessary.
For this sake the Field-Feynman-Fox evolution variable is modified by
correcting its arguments:
 Q**2 = 2*s*tc*uc/(s**2+tc**2+uc**2), tc = t - mq**2, uc = u - mq**2
where s, t and u are the Mandelstam invariant variables for the parton
subprocess, and mq is the heavy quark mass. One has: s + tc + uc = 0.
The minimum Q**2 at a given s is determined by:
 t(min) = -(SQRT(s)/2 - SQRT(s/4-mq**2))**2
This gives a limit at large s for Q**2 equal to mq**2. At s = 4*mq**2 one
has Q**2 = (4/3)*mq**2. Therefore, it always is Q**2 > mq**2. PTCUTF is
set equal to MAX(mq,QZEVOL*1.01). In the final printout, the entry
PT CUTOFF is set equal to SQRT(PTCUTF**2-mq**2), which corresponds to the
approximate value of the asymptotic cutoff for the parton transverse
momentum. If it is zero and if PTFFFM has been left to its default value by
the user, then no pt cutoff is operating and the quoted X-section is the
total fusion X-section. If mq < QZEVOL, PT CUTOFF is greater than zero. In
practice, that is the case for charm quarks. To get the total fusion
X-section for charm, one must decrease QZEVOL to a value lower than mq. For
consistency, also the input parton densities should be suitably modified.

      The FORCE keyword requires special care. Its list must contain
the numerical ident codes, e.g.
FORCE
140,130,-120,0,0,0
The parent ident code must be positive, and the charge-conjugate mode
is also forced for its antiparticle. Thus the above example forces both
AD0 --> K+ PI- and D0 --> K- PI+. Modes not listed in the decay table
are NOT allowed. The order of secondaries must be the same as in the decay
table. FORCE can be called at most 100 times. It can be called more than
once for a given parent: its decay will occur into the selected decay modes
according to the decay table branching ratios. The quoted cross section
SIGF is NOT corrected for the effects of FORCE.

      The (unevolved) input parton densities can be defined by the user by
simply replacing FUNCTION F2IN(X,IT). This must return the parton density
times X or the sum of parton densities times X, as specified by IT = 1 (up),
2 (ub), 3 (dn), 4 (db), 5 (st + sb), 6 (up + ub + dn + db + st + sb), 7 (gl).
X and F2IN must be defined of single or double precision type, according
to which PATCHY flag, SINGLE or DOUBLE PRECISION, has been selected.(For
STRUC chosen as NA3, in input, the nucleon momentum fraction carried by
gluons, AGLU (/ALQGEN/), is calculated elsewhere in the program before the
gluon density is used. Except for that, the parton density specification
(IEICHT within the program) is used only in F2IN and in the auxiliary
function FGLU, which is called only by F2IN.)

      Arrays with variable dimensions, like those holding the particle
and parton streams, have their dimension parameters set in PARAMETER
statements placed in the same patchy KEEP blocks containing the common blocks
to which the arrays belong. In the output listing, dimension usage for such
arrays during the run is reported. In the case of dimension overflow, the
program prints a warning, cancels the current event and continues execution
for the first 100 overflows. If more than 100 overflows are found, the job
is aborted. The user can freely change the dimension control parameters
listed in output, the only restriction coming from the values of the packing
parameters, also set by PARAMETER statements placed in the same patchy KEEP
blocks containing the relevant common blocks. There are two such packing
parameters, one for the particle stream, IPACK, and one for the parton
stream, JPACK. Both of them should be larger than the dimension control
parameters for the particle and parton streams, i.e.
      IPACK, JPACK > MXPART, MXJSET
(there are cross references between the two streams). The current values of
dimension control parameters are adequate for running up to 2 TeV in cms
energy (leaving the relevant input parameters to their default values).

      Here is a number of sample sets of input cards for a variety of
running conditions.
