[4] BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

      The IOCON interface is largely backward compatible with usage of
previous versions of COJETS, although some modifications are necessary. This
is especially true for the Drell-Yan production of Z/W/GAMMA, which was
previously dealt with in the separate program WIZJET. Here are given details
about the necessary modifications.

      MAIN PROGRAM.
      i) GEVENT must now be called at the beginning of event generation, and
gives control back to the main program at the end of it. Therefore it must be
called only once, and must not appear in a loop. It also handles Drell-Yan
production.
      ii) Calls to PREGEN, PRHEAD, BHEAD, BOOKH and OUTH should be eliminated.
They are now made by GEVENT.

      USER ROUTINES. Subroutines BOOKH and OUTH must always be supplied now,
even if containing a RETURN statement only.

      INPUT.
      i) All input parameters are now in GeV.
      ii) For Drell-Yan production, the calls to WEAKIN and DREYIN must be
replaced by setting the input parameters IEVTYP, IDECBO, LWIDTH and, for e.m.
Drell-Yan, the mass range parameters BOMSMN and BOMSMX. The masses of Z and W
can be changed from their default values by setting them in the
particle-decay table.
      iii) QZMASS is now set equal to QMAS, except for its first 3 components
which are set to 0.
      iv) QMAS can no longer be used in input, and quark masses should be
changed by the user in the particle-decay table.
      v) The arguments of FUSION and FLAVEX must be character*2 variables,
complying with the new quark label codes, defined in the particle table.
      vi) FREEZE is no longer supported, although it is still available (its
argument must be a character*5 variable with left adjustement, the new quark
label codes must be used). Absence of parton hadronization should be
requested by setting the input parameter KHADRO to 0.
      vii) Parameters SIGMA and CX2, defining jet fragmentation, have been
doubled for quark and gluon jets.

      OUTPUT.
      i) The output common blocks have been internally rearranged. That is
         irrelevant if PATCHY +CDE cards are employed to copy them into the
         user subroutines.
      i) PARQUA(I,7), giving the jet origin, has changed its coding.
      ii) PARHAD(I,7), giving the particle origin, has changed its coding.
      iii) Common block /HADQN/ no longer exists. Its information is now
         available from the function CHARGE, and by unpacking the external
         IDENT code for particles, which yields their quark contents.
      iv) Internal particle codes for baryons have been changed. They
         are listed in the particle data table printed by the program.

      The routines LOOSEQ, SPECTJ, STABKP and SHOCAS are no longer
supported, although they are still available. The routines FORSLE and
LOOSEH are no longer available.

      Forcing of semileptonic decays of heavy flavor particles should be
implemented using FORCSL. Full information about the parton shower
development is available through /JETSET/. Full information about the
particle decay cascades is available in PARHAD by setting the input
parameter NOUNST to .FALSE..
