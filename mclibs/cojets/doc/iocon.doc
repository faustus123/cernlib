[7] USAGE WITH THE CONVENTIONAL I/O INTERFACE (IOCON)

      COJETS is steered by a MAIN program, to be supplied by the user, and
during its execution calls three user routines: BOOKH, FILLH and OUTH.

      The MAIN program sets the input variables, accessed through the
appropriate input common blocks, makes optional command calls and eventually
calls the event generator GEVENT.

      BOOKH is called before event generation, and is meant for preliminary
user operations, like histogram booking or writing a beginning record on
tape.

      FILLH is called after each event generation. By accessing the output
common blocks, the user can place in this routine intructions for event
analysis, histogram filling or event writing on tape.

      OUTH is called after event generation has been terminated. The user
can get here the cross section value applying to the run conditions and
the number of generated events, through the appropriate common block. He
can also perform final operations for the event analysis and for histograms
(e.g. renormalization to the cross section value), and he can terminate
tape writing by a final record.

      To set up a job with the conventional I/O interface, the user must
go through the following steps. Details about them can be found in the
quoted sections.

  i)  Get the FORTRAN ASM file for COJETS by running YPATCHY with the
      *COJCONV pilot patch, [5].

 ii)  Set up a MAIN program, [8], containing assignments of input parameters
      and optional command calls, [9].

iii)  Set up the user subroutines BOOKH, FILLH and OUTH, [8], by making use
      of the output common blocks, [10].

 iv)  Link the CERN Program Library, or substitutes for it, [6].

  v)  Make the particle-decay table file available to the program for
      reading, [5,16].


      Sample sets of the MAIN program and of the user subroutines BOOKH,
FILLH and OUTH are given in [8].
