[9] INPUT FOR IOCON

      Input parameters should be set in the main program before calling
GEVENT. The same applies to all command calls, except for PARTAB. A CALL
PARTAB placed after CALL GEVENT causes the printing of the particle and
decay table, modified by the STOPD and FORCE commands.
      Units are GeV for energy and momentum, and millibarns for cross
sections.

         always calculated by the program.)
         (Default: 1).

            1 - purely hadronic

             in the decay process can be set by LWIDTH.

         must be PTMIN > QZEV.

         If it is larger than its default value, it is set to its default
         value.

                      ID2 + ID3 + ID4 + ID5, using external IDENT codes for
                      particles. The decay must appear in the decay table,
                      with the same order for the secondaries. The
                      charge-conjugate decay mode is forced for the
                      antiparticle. FORCE can be called up to 100 times.
                      More decays can be forced for the same parent particle,
                      its decay will then occur into the selected decay
                      modes according to the decay table BR's. The quoted
                      X-section is not corrected for the effects of FORCE.

                      or 2 is the number of heavy flavor particles forced to
                      decay. Particles originating from the heavy quarks
                      of highest pt are selected for the forcing.
                      For IEVTYP = 1, a call to FUSION, FLAVEX, GSPLIT or

                      to the primary production of HFLAV quarks.
                      For IEVTYP =3, NTIMES can only be 1 and IDECBO must
                      select the channel leading to the primary production
                      of a HFLAV quark.
                      The quoted X-section is corrected for the effects
                      induced by FORCSL on the decay of the chosen
                      heavy flavor particles (of course the bias due to the
                      selection of the largest pt heavy quarks for applying
                      the forcing cannot be corrected for).

CALL HEAVYQ(HFLAV)  : to force production of heavy flavor HFLAV, including
                      fusion, flavor excitation and gluon splitting, where
                      HFLAV = 'CH', 'BT', 'TP'. (Do not use it for accurate
                      X-section determination.)

CALL PARTAB         : causes the printing of the particle and decay table,
                      modified by STOPD and FORCE commands. It must be
                      placed after the call to GEVENT.

CALL STOPD(ID)      : makes particle with external particle IDENT code ID
                      stable, together with its charge conjugate partner if
                      there is one.


NOTE: Only ONE call to either FUSION, FLAVEX, GSPLIT or HEAVYQ is accepted.


      The practical problem of forcing the generation of statistically
unfavored events is treated in the following cases:
i) parton pt forcing, ii) forcing of heavy flavor production, iii) forcing
of semileptonic decays of heavy flavor particles.
      i) Parton pt forcing. In order to generate only events with PTHARD
above some value, larger than PTMIN, one must set PTMGE to that value.
PTMIN should not be changed for this sake. It defines the QCD X-section,
and thus the relative fraction of hard events when running with PTMGE=0,
which is given by the ratio of the QCD X-section to the total inelastic
X-section, defined by SIGINL. Usage of PTMAX is meant for supplementary,
corrective runs. E.g., it may turn out that for a specific event selection,
like events with a muon above some pt value, the events generated in a
first run have a PTHARD distribution that appears abruptly truncated at
PTMGE. That indicates that also lower PTHARD's should have contributed to
the same sample. Without throwing away the biased event sample, one can
integrate it by a second run where PTMGE is set to a lower, safe value
and PTMAX is set to the PTMGE value of the first run, thus avoiding
double counting. The two event samples should then be weighted by the
corresponding ratios SIGTOT/NEVNTS (/TOTAL/). As an alternative option,
the program allows to enrich the event generation at large PTHARD without
any cutoff but with a weight attached to the events. The option can be
activated by setting IPTWGT = 1. The PTHARD distribution on which the
sampling is made is then multiplied by the function PTWGT(QSQ), where
QSQ = PTHARD**2. Function PTWGT can be modified at will by the user,
avoiding singularities in the QSQ generation range. The event weight is
given in output in common block /EVENT/. This type of pt forcing may
become statistically unsafe and should be used with caution.
      ii) Forcing of heavy flavor production. One can choose between a
forcing comprehensive of fusion, flavor excitation and gluon splitting
(HEAVYQ),  or select the fusion (FUSION), flavor excitation (FLAVEX) and
gluon splitting (GSPLIT) mechanisms separately. The latter option is to be
preferred for accurate X-section determinations. When activating
HEAVYQ one can monitor the relative importance of the three mechanisms
by sorting events using the LINV and LFINV (/EVINT/) parameters. At a pt
small with respect to the heavy quark mass, superimposing the three
mechanisms leads to multiple counting. At such small pt's one is supposed
to employ a full O(alphas**3) approximation, which is not yet available in
exclusive form (the results of Nason et al. (1987), cover only the total
and the single inclusive cross section). A reasonable sustitute for it is
the O(alphas**2) approximation represented by the fusion process.
      iii) Forcing of semileptonic decays of heavy flavor particles. That
can be done by using FORCSL. Although the X-section is corrected for the
decay forcing by taking into account the appropriate branching ratios, one
should not forget the bias associated with the choice of the particles to
force in the event. The selection is done according to the pt of the
originating quark jet, particles belonging to the highest pt jets being
selected. That can introduce a negligible bias when studying, e.g., decay
leptons at very high pt. But of course it is not appropriate for studying
leptons at small or moderate pt, since it leads to an underestimation of
the contribution from events where the leptons are originated by heavy
quarks with smaller pt.

      When FUSION is forced, in order to calculate the X-section including
all pt's, some changes for the QCD evolution variable are necessary.
For this sake the Field-Feynman-Fox evolution variable is modified by
correcting its arguments:
 Q**2 = 2*s*tc*uc/(s**2+tc**2+uc**2), tc = t - mq**2, uc = u - mq**2
where s, t and u are the Mandelstam invariant variables for the parton
subprocess, and mq is the heavy quark mass. One has: s + tc + uc = 0.
The minimum Q**2 at a given s is determined by:
 t(min) = -(sqrt(s)/2 - sqrt(s/4-mq**2))**2
This gives a lower limit for Q**2 at large s equal to mq**2. At s = 4*mq**2
one has Q**2 = (4/3)*mq**2. Therefore, it always is Q**2 > mq**2.
PTMIN is set equal to max(mq,QZEV*1.01). In the final printout, the entry
PT CUTOFF is set equal to sqrt(PTMIN**2-mq**2), which corresponds to the
approximate value of the asymptotic cutoff for the parton transverse
momentum. If it is zero and if PTMGE has been left to its default value by
the user, then no pt cutoff is operating and the quoted X-section is the
total fusion X-section. If mq < QZEV, PT CUTOFF is greater than zero. In
practice, that is the case for charm quarks. To get the total fusion
X-section for charm, one must decrease QZEV to a value lower than mq. For
consistency, also the input parton densities should be suitably modified.

      The (unevolved) input parton densities can be defined by the user by
simply replacing FUNCTION F2IN(X,IT). This must return the parton density
times X or the sum of parton densities times X, as specified by IT = 1 (up),
2 (ub), 3 (dn), 4 (db), 5 (st + sb), 6 (up + ub + dn + db + st + sb), 7 (gl).
X and F2IN must be defined of single or double precision type, according
to which PATCHY flag, SINGLE or DOUBLE PRECISION, has been selected. (For
IEICHT=0 the nucleon momentum fraction carried by gluons, AGLU (/ALQGEN/),
is calculated elsewhere in the program before the gluon density is used.
Except for that, IEICHT is used only in F2IN and in the auxiliary function
FGLU, which is called by F2IN only.)

      Arrays with variable dimensions, like those holding the particle
and parton streams, have their dimension parameters set in PARAMETER
statements placed in the same patchy KEEP blocks containing the common blocks
to which the arrays belong. In the output listing, dimension usage for such
arrays during the run is reported. In the case of dimension overflow, the
program prints a warning, cancels the current event and continues execution
for the first 100 overflows. If more than 100 overflows are found, the job
is aborted. The user can freely change the dimension control parameters
listed in output, the only restriction coming from the values of the packing
parameters, also set by PARAMETER statements placed in the same patchy KEEP
blocks containing the relevant common blocks. There are two such packing
parameters, one for the particle stream, IPACK, and one for the parton
stream, JPACK. Both of them should be larger than the dimension control
parameters for the particle and parton streams, i.e.
      IPACK, JPACK > MXPART, MXJSET
(there are cross references between the two streams). The current values of
dimension control parameters are adequate for running up to 2 TeV in cms
energy (leaving the relevant input parameters to their default values).
