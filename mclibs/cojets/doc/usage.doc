[3] GENERALITIES ON USAGE

      Two distinct input/output (I/O) interfaces are available for COJETS:
the original, conventional one and an ISAJET type one. For brevity, they
will be referred to as IOCON and IOISA.

      IOCON is the original COJETS I/O interface. It is meant to be flexible
and can be easily adapted to practically any kind of environment. The user
must supply a main program, which steers the event generation. After each
event is generated, control is given to a user supplied routine where the
event parameters stored in the output common blocks can be accessed. The user
is free to make the event analysis on line, or to store the events on tape.
He is completely free to organize the user routines as he prefers. This
interface is backward compatible with previous versions of COJETS, apart
from marginal modifications, [4]. See section [7] for a detailed introduction
to IOCON.

      IOISA parallels as much as possible the I/O user interface adopted
by the Monte Carlo event generation program ISAJET, by F.E. Paige and
S.D. Protopopescu. A complete identity is not possible because of the
substantial differences between the algorithmic approaches of the two
programs. Input to the program is from data cards, and output is on tape.
The user is supposed to read the tape in order to analyse the generated
events. This interface is meant to facilitate users accustomed to ISAJET
and to make it easier to have comparisons between the results of the two
programs. See section [11] for a detailed introduction to IOISA.

      The structures of output common blocks for the two interfaces are
somewhat different. Therefore it would not be straightforward to adapt
event analysis routines developed for one interface to the other interface.

      The external particle identity codes are the same for both interfaces.
They are those of ISAJET 6.00. Also the particle decay table has been
taken from ISAJET 6.00. New options for it are available to handle
experimentally unknown decay modes. See section [16] for details about the
particle and decay table. With IOCON also the original COJETS particle
codes are available in output, with due extension to the baryons. (They are
used internally, to provide efficient storage of particle parameters.)

      COJETS is maintained with the PATCHY code management system. The
appropriate FORTRAN codes for usage with the two interfaces are obtained
by means of suitable pilot patches, [5].

      A few external routines are needed for COJETS to run, like e.g. the
random number generator. They are all part of the CERN Program Library.
If the latter is not available directions about how to substitute them
can be found in [6].

      Backward compatibility is assured by the IOCON interface. Details
are given in [4].
