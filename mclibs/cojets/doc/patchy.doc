[5] PATCHY

      PATCHY is a code management system developed at CERN. The COJETS file
is supplied in the form of a PATCHY CARDS file. Instructions for using PATCHY
and a PATCHY installation tape are available on request from the CERN DD
Division.

      The COJETS PAM file is divided into the following PATCHes:

COJCDE    contains all common blocks, etc.
COJDATA   contains BLOCK DATA COJVER, and the BLOCK DATA, each one on a
          separate DECK (COJVER and DATA, resp.).
COJETS    contains the code for generating events. Each subroutine is
          in a separate DECK with the same name.
COJTAPEW  contains the code for writing tapes, with each subroutine
          on a separate DECK (IOISA).
COJTAPER  contains the code for reading tapes, with each subroutine
          on a separate DECK (IOISA).
COJPLT    contains the skeleton of a histogramming job using HBOOK (IOISA).
COJCONV   contains shells of the main program and user routines, each one
          on a separate DECK (IOCON).
COJTEXT   contains the instructions for using COJETS, i.e. the text of
          this document.
COJTABLE  contains the particle and decay table.

      In addition, there are patches representing sample set-ups for the
IOCON main program and user routines, in the form of correction patches for
COJCONV. They are described in [8]. There is also a patch GAMMA, containing
the gamma function. It can be +USE selected if the gamma function is not
available otherwise.

      After having compacted the CARDS file into a binary PAM file, by
the use of YTOBIN, one must use YPATCHY to get from it, with the optional
addition of corrections, the desired ASM file containing the
selected/modified FORTRAN code ready for compilation. In order to facilitate
input to YPATCHY, the COJETS file contains the following pilot patches:

*COJCONV      +USE selects COJCDE, COJDATA, COJETS and corrections to them.
              It is meant for running COJETS with IOCON.
*COJETS       +USE selects COJCDE, COJDATA, COJETS, COJTAPEW and corrections
              to them. It is meant for running COJETS with IOISA.
*COJPLT       +USE selects COJCDE, COJTAPER, COJPLT and appropriate decks of
              COJDATA and COJETS plus corrections to them. It is meant for
              reading and analysing an IOISA tape.
*COJTEXT      +USE selects COJCDE, COJTEXT and corrections to them. The ASM
              file in output contains the documentation text to read.
*COJTABLE     +USE selects COJTABLE and corrections to it. The ASM file in
              output contains the particle-decay table to be read by COJETS.

      One of the flags SINGLE, DOUBLE must be used to select single or
double precision.

      One of the flags CRAY, CDC, IBM, VAX must be used to select the
machine dependent features of CERN Library routines used by COJETS.

      In order to get the desired ASM file, it should be sufficient to run
YPATCHY with the following cradle (with all cards starting with + in column
1):

 USE,(SINGLE,DOUBLE).                                         choose one
 USE,(CRAY,CDC,IBM,VAX).                                      choose one
 USE,(*COJCONV,*COJETS,*COJPLT,*COJTEXT,*COJTABLE)            choose one
 EXE.
 PAM.
 QUIT.

      User modifications to COJETS can be included in the YPATCHY input. They
should be kept temporary to avoid conflict with later corrective patches.
