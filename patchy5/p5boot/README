Building the Nypatchy (Patchy 5) suite using the standard Cernlib build
procedures or the Patchy CAR files requires an executable of nypatchy or
ypatchy (Patchy 4). The procedure below can be used to bootstrap
nypatchy.

Sources for Solaris version of nypatchy, which will probably work on
most 32-bit systems. The system dependent routines are in kernlib for
each system.

nypatchy.f	 Main program for Patchy 5
p5lib		 Other source (*.f) files common to all P5 programs.

Then to make nypatchy, assuming the Fortran compiler is g77:
cd p5lib
g77 -c libp5/*.f
ar cr libp5.a *.o
g77 -o nypatchy nypatchy.f libp5.a $CERN_ROOT/lib/libkernlib.a

The nypatchy executable should then be copied to the bin directory,
where it might also be necessary to make a link, e.g
mv nypatchy $CERN_ROOT/bin
ln -s nypatchy ypatchy
