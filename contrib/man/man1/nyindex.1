.SH NAME
nyindex \- tool to print index of specialized\-format patches
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nyindex
.IR "pam options" " [ " print " ] [ .go ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBnyindex\fP is a tool in the Nypatchy suite of programs
for working with Patchy Master Files (PAM files);
see \fBnypatchy\fP(1).  Specifically, it can output a table of contents
and/or index for these files.
.SH USAGE
The parameter \fIpam\fP is the name of the PAM file (a default extension
of ".car" is assumed), \fIprint\fP is the output file to write to
(the default is standard output if omitted), and \fIoptions\fP is a sequence
of single\-character flags.
.PP
The command should be ended with ".go" unless one wants to enter the
Nypatchy interactive shell.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Note that options should be given as a single string of characters with
no space separation and no use of the \- character (except that it can be
used in place of the options field if no options are desired).
Alphabetic options are not case\-sensitive.
.TP
B
Print bare table of contents without comments.
.TP
H
Print help information only.
.TP
P
Patch names only in the table of contents.
.TP
Q
Quick: suppress the table of contents.
.TP
X
Suppress the index of patch, deck, and sequence names.
.TP
Y
Suppress the index of deck and sequence names.
.TP
Z
Suppress the index of sequence names.
.TP
.I n
For \fIn\fP a number from 0 to 4 inclusive, assume 58, 62, 74, 84, or 98 lines
per page in the output.  (The default is 110 lines per page.)  For \fIn\fP
a number greater than or equal to 20, use that specific number of lines per
page.
