.TH PAW 1 "Physics Analysis Workstation"
.SH NAME
paw \- invoke the "Physics Analysis Workstation" package
.SH SYNOPSIS
paw [\-b \fImacro_name\fR] [\-w \fIworkstation_type\fR] [\-n]

paw++ [\-b \fImacro_name\fR] [\-n]

.SH DESCRIPTION

PAW
is an interactive utility for visualizing experimental data on a
computer graphics display. It may be run in batch mode if desired
for very large and time consuming data analyses; typically, however,
the user will decide on an analysis procedure interactively before
running a batch job.

PAW
combines a handful of CERN High Energy Physics Library systems
that may also be used individually in software that
processes and displays data.  The purpose of PAW is
to provide many common analysis and display
procedures that would be duplicated needlessly
by individual programmers, to supply a flexible way to invoke these
common procedures, and yet also to allow user customization where
necessary.

Paw++ is a Motif-based version of PAW.

.SS OPTIONS

When
.B paw
starts, the macro
.B
pawlogon.kumac
in the current directory is executed. If this macro doesn't exist
the system tries to execute the macro
.B .pawlogon.kumac
in the home directory.
.TP 8
.RI \-n
The macro \fIpawlogon\fR is not executed.
.TP 8
.RI \-b \ macro_name
The macro specified is executed in batch mode and
.B paw
exits when the macro ends.
.TP 8
.RI \-w \ workstation_type
PAW starts immediately without prompting for the workstation type.
If workstation_type = 0, paw starts without graphics.

When the X11 version of paw is used, a list of 10 valid
workstation types is provided in the file
.B higz_windows.dat.
By default this file is in the current directory. If it is not,
the one in the home directory is used. If it is not in the home
directory, one is automatically created in the current directory.
Each line in this file describes the position and the size of the
window. To access one of the described windows it is enough to
give the line number in reply to the prompt "Workstation type"

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP 20
HIGZPRINTER
Specifies the command line executed when the command PICTURE/PRINT
is invoked.
.TP 20
KUIPPAGER, PAGER
Checked in this order to determine what pager program to use.  If neither
are set, 'sensible\-pager' is used in Debian.
.TP 20
KUIPEDITOR, EDITOR
Checked in this order to determine what editor to use.  If neither are
set, 'sensible\-editor' is used in Debian.
.TP 20
KUIPPSVIEWER, PSVIEWER
Checked in this order to determine the program to use for viewing PostScript.
If neither are set, 'gv' is used.
.TP 20
$ENV()
Any environment variable can be accessed in paw with the function
.B $ENV().
