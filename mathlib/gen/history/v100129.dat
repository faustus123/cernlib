C--
C--       THE COMBINATION
C--          +USE,CDC,FORTRAN.
C--       WILL GIVE FOR EXAMPLE A CDC VERSION WHICH IS FORTRAN 77 IF BOTH
C--       FORTRAN AND ASSEMBLER EXIST FOR THE SAME ROUTINE AND ASSEMBLER
C--       IF ONLY AN ASSEMBLER VERSION EXISTS, WHEREAS
C--         +USE,CDC.
C--       WILL GIVE THE OPTIMUM CDC VERSION OF COMPASS ROUTINES AND FORTRAN 77.
C--       FOR MACHINES OTHER THAN IBM,CDC,VAX,UNIVAC,PDP,NORD OR CRAY  GIVE
C--          +USE,FORTRAN.       FOR FORTRAN 77
C--          +USE,FORTRAN,F4.    FOR FORTRAN 66
C--       IN SOME ROUTINES THIS GIVES THE ASSUMPTION OF A 32-BIT MACHINE.
C--
C--          NOTE THAT THE IBM FORTRAN 77 VERSION IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE SIEMENS
C--          (FACOM) COMPILER AND WITH THE IBM VS-FORTRAN COMPILER RELEASE 3.
C--          THE VAX AND APOLLO VERSIONS HAVE ONLY BEEN TESTED AS FORTRAN
