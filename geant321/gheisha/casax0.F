C *** CASCADE OF XI0 BAR ***
C *** NVE 17-JAN-1989 CERN GENEVA ***
C
C XI0 BAR UNDERGOES INTERACTION WITH NUCLEON WITHIN NUCLEUS.
C CHECK IF ENERGETICALLY POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE PIONS/KAONS.
C IF NOT, ASSUME NUCLEAR EXCITATION OCCURS, DEGRADE INPUT PARTICLE
C IN ENERGY AND NO OTHER PARTICLES ARE PRODUCED.
C IF REACTION IS POSSIBLE FIND CORRECT NUMBER OF PIONS/PROTONS/
C NEUTRONS PRODUCED USING AN INTERPOLATION TO MULTIPLICITY DATA.
C REPLACE SOME PIONS OR PROTONS/NEUTRONS BY KAONS OR STRANGE BARYONS
C ACCORDING TO AVERAGE MULTIPLICITY PER INELASTIC REACTIONS.
