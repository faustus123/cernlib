*-- Author :    O.Couet   02/11/93
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/11   28/02/94 11.26.52
*
*   Bugs fixed in IGTABL (default parameter values initialization).
*   IGERR was called in IGWKTY without LUNERR and LUNOUT initialized.
*   Update in IZHIST to take into account the new 'Z' option of IGHIST.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/10   21/02/94 11.15.35
*
*   Mods in IGTEXT, IKFNTX *HIGZ and *HIGZEXAM for Windows-NT (Valery Fine)
*   New option 'Z' in IGHIST. Like in IGRAPH, if it is selected, the vectors
*      X and Y are taken into PAWC at the adresses IQUEST(81) and IQUEST(82).
*      This protect agains the ZEBRA garbage collections.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/09   26/01/94 09.21.23
*
*   IGPICK is now able to pick IGARC.
*   Mod in IXOPNDS (x11int): The display was reopen for each window.
*   The READ in IGWKTY is in FORTRAN (IXGETL under the flag CCREAD) because
*      KUIP do the READ in FORTRAN (cf FFREAD).
*   Mod in ISTXFP for the FALCO driver.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/08   20/01/94 11.30.15
*
*   The 3D is available (ISWN3, ISVP3) for the X11 only. ntmgt should be
*      used also with the GKS version.
*   New routine IXDOGIF to produce gif files. It is available only if
*      if the FLAG GIF is selected.
*   Correction in IKERNEL/IPM: The marker size was not linear
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/07   17/01/94 18.06.42
*
*   Mods in the FALCO driver: John Clement
*   Protection added in IZDIPI. (LN)
*   IXCLSDS perform immediatly a return if display=NULL
*   Bug fixed in IHPVIE (a RETURN was missing).
*   Mods in IOPWK, IGWKTY, IGINIT and IKFILE to be able to call
*      IGWKTY before or after IGINIT.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/06   07/01/94 18.38.19
*
*   Mod in IGXMES for IBM/VM.
*   New 3D routines: ISWN3 and ISVP3. See the HIGZ manual for more details
*   Protection added in IHSDRL (if NT > NTMAX).
*   Mods in IGTABL to use the new 3D routines
*   Mods for FALCO driver: John Clement, Rice University
*      <CLEMENT@physics.rice.edu>. I some places, test like IWTYPE.EQ.7878
*      should be IGIWTY(IWKID).EQ.7878
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/05   08/12/93 09.33.04
*
*   Bug fixed in IGAXIS. In some cases (it seems very rarely because
*      the code has not change in this part since at least 3 years)
*      in the test:
*          IF((X00-XONE).GT.EPSIL) GOTO 150
*      EPSIL was to big. Now the test is:
*          IF(X00.GT.XONE) GOTO 150
*      and in fact that is what is needed in this case.
*   Changes in rotated to avoid warnings with /com/cc on APOLLO.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/04   26/11/93 13.42.06
*
*   Fix in higzcc/rotated for IBM/VM: The text width returned for
*      lowercase is 0. Now it is protected.
*   New routine IGDWK to Get the Default WorKstation type. This
*      routine is called by IGWKTY.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/03   23/11/93 11.44.01
*
*   Mods in IGCOLM in order to support default position and color map.
*   The xvertext package to rotate and scale X11 fonts is now available
*      in higzcc/rotated (Alan Richardson(mppa3@uk.ac.sussex.syma))
*      Now the X11 fonts are managed as follows:
*            font=xx precision=0 : X11 font a rotated
*            font=xx precision=1 : IGTEXT is used on the screen
*            font=xx precision=2 : X11 font a rotated and scaled.
*   Fix in higzcc/rotated for IBM/VM.
*   Protection added in ixgetge: sometimes (for instance after a CTRL-C),
*      XGetGeometry returns wrong values. In this case the previous "good
*      values" are used.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/02   08/11/93 09.53.03
*
*   IXSELWI is now called in IACWK (X11) to be sure the window
*      in active even if IGTERM is not called.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/01   03/11/93 11.12.27
*
*   The unused routine IGPHSL is now removed.
*   The PATCH IGKS3D is removed (not used and not documented). The
*      related routines in IG and the corresding KEEP in HICDES are
*      also removed.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.20/00   02/11/93 17.44.57
*
*   Some unused sequences are removed.
