*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/12   25/10/94 13.47.24
*
*   Bug fixed in IPIOUT: the I7 format was too small. It is now I15.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/11   21/10/94 12.01.27
*
*   Improvement in IGAXIS in case of integer labelling. The optimization
*      provide by IGAXI0 is better than the one provide by IGAXI4. When
*      integer labelling is required, IGAXI0 is invoke first and only
*      if the result is not an integer labelling, IGAXI4 is invoked.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/10   17/10/94 15.08.15
*
*   VIDQQ is now removed from IGINIT because it is now in igvers.
*   Mods IGAXIS to have a better drawing of label like 10^xxx: Now we
*      take into account the length of the exponant to avoid
*      overlapping text. (improvement suggested by Mike Kelsey).
*   New option HWCO in IGQWK to return the number of hardware colours
*      available.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/09   27/09/94 17.41.14
*
*   In IGPICK, TA_IND was not declared as an INTEGER. It is now
*      replaced by ITAIND.
*   Mods in X11INT: VAX machines was asumed to be X11R3 now
*      they are consider as X11R4 (at least) machines. APOLLO machines
*      are still consider as X11R3 machines.
*   Bug fixed in IACWK (X11 version). The line width set was not the
*      same as the one set by ISLWSC.
*   Bug fixed in ICLKS. This routine close all the workstations still
*      open. It was looping on ILOPWK but this list was changed by
*      ICLWK, so ICLKS tried to close a non opened workstation. Now
*      ILOPWK is copied in an intermediate array.
*   Mods in IRQST/GPR. A small editor is now available.
*      (Robert Franchisseur robert@ramses.ibp.fr)
*   New C routine igvers to return the current HIGZ version. It is
*      used by the PAW command BUGREPORT
*   Precision problem in LOG scale has been solved (hopefully) in
*      IGAXIS. (XMNLOG-IH1).GT.EPSIL is now (XMNLOG-IH1).GT.0.. This
*      problem has been reflected in the pawdemo file.
*   Protection added in ISTXAL (IKERNEL): ixsetta was called even
*      with GFLAG=.FALSE.
*   New option 'X' in IGZSET to turn OFF the 'Z' mode without changing
*      the 'G' mode (used in HPLOPT).
*   New set of pattern in the X11 driver.
*   The Fill Pattern from 1 to 25 are now available also on PS files.
*      be careful with GhostView because to many filled areas with
*      such patterns can block this program.
*   Speed optimization in the PS file writing (a factor 3.6). A fast
*      writting routine has been introduced (IPPSTF entry point of
*      IPPSTR). In IPIOUT some code of IPPSTR is now inlined. IPDRAW
*      call has been replaced by two IPIOUT calls. The speed up gained
*      is the following (a 100x100 scatter plot):
*         Real time 00:01:08 (Old version)
*         Real time 00:00:34 (new IPIOUT)
*         Real time 00:00:22 (IPPSTF and inline in IPIOUT)
*         Real time 00:00:19 (suppress IPDRAW in IZPM)
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/08   22/07/94 15.22.13
*
*   New routine IXWARP in x11int to move the pointer at a given
*      position (Adeyemi Adesanya).
*   New routine IZPAVE to store IGPAVE as a macro primitive. It implies
*      also mods in IZDNB and IGPICK.
*   Mods in IGRAP1 (push the LX and LY banks) in order to draw
*      filled area in one go.
*   Changes in IGPICK to pick text (Yemi)
*   A blank was missing in IPFON (DECS only)
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/07   30/06/94 14.56.15
*
*   Protection added in IKFILE (ERR=999 in the last READ).
*   New routine IXQPTR in x11int to query the current pointer
*      position (Adeyemi Adesanya).
*   Mods in IGTAB5 to return in QUEST the axis positions (useful
*      for HPLOT to draw the axis titles).
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/06   27/06/94 18.21.00
*
*   Mods in IZFILE to take into account the new option 'N' of RZMAKE.
*   Mods in IGTABL and IGTAB2 in order to close the surface plots
*      when the options POL, CYL, SPH or PSD are used.
*   Bug fixed in ixreqlo (x11int) when a button was pressed, the
*      cursor was undefined but not set to NULL (now it is).
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/05   17/06/94 17.41.08
*
*   Bug fixed in IXCLSDS (X11INT): isdisp was not reset.
*      (Thierry MOUTHUY, <mouthuy@marpix1.in2p3.fr>).
*   New options 'E' and 'C' in IGZSET.
*   New options 'FB' and 'BB' in IGTABL.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/04   10/06/94 15.05.39
*
*   New option 'K' in IGHIST (histogram are pacKed like in HBOOK).
*   Fix in X11INT/ixreqst: in some cases, the '?' cursor was not
*      set correctly.
*   Protection added in IZPM and IGAXIS: when IGTEXT is called with
*      option 'S', the ANGLE parameter should be initialize to 0.
*   Optimization in IGAXIS to avoid identical labels on the same
*      axis (IF1 and IF2 too small), and to avoid x10^0.
*   In the sequence HIATT, all the variables are now declared.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/03   06/06/94 13.34.58
*
*   New version of IZPM (PS driver) to have shorter files.
*   Mods in IKFNTX to have a better maping between X11 and PS fonts.
*   Interface to GKSBx (CMZ flag: GKSBX).
*   Mods in IGKS and IDI3000 to use the C management of the NTs.
*   The cursor is reset after a request locator in sample mode (X11).
*   Mods is IPTEXT: the "stwn" value is now printed in I6.
*   Bug fixed in IGSA (FALCO version): it was a side effect of the
*     last mod apply for GPR (bug reported by Andrea Parri).
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/02   19/05/94 10.09.37
*
*   Bug fixed in IGAXIS (precision problem on IBM/VM). This was a side
*      effect of the fix made in the version 1.20/05 for the X00 and
*      XONE comparison. Now the variable XMNSAV is not used, only XMNLOG
*      is used.
*   Bug fixed in IGSA (GPR version). GPR_RELEASE_DISPLAY was not
*      called if no workstation was opened.
*   Bug fixed in the PostScript driver: if EPS is selected and if the
*      BoundingBox is not yet in the file, the clipping cannot be set.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/01   11/05/94 18.57.56
*
*   New option 'W' in IGPXMP (write a pixmap in a bitmap file).
*   Major changes in the PostScript driver: the clipping is now
*      managed in the PS file itself.
*
*::>          VERSION  1.21/00   30/03/94 18.14.42
*
*   IGINIT: If GKSIBM is selected, METDEF = 3
*   In IGSA (DECGKS), '\' is now BSLASH (AlphaVMS).
