*      labeled axis.
*   Line type for FALCO implemented (merlant@csnvs1.in2p3.fr).

*
*   Improvment in IPSCOL (set the PostScript Color): if the color is

*
*   The string CHHOST in HIKERC was too small it is now 80 characters.
*      (mjk@illini.physics.utah.edu)
*   "IF=" on PATCH cards.
*   In the X11 driver, the class hint is now equal to "HIGZ" (W.Brueckner).
*
*::>          VERSION  1.18/01   930511 17.24
*
*   The X11 mode to draw the cursor in ixreqlo is define according to
*      the XServerVendor output.
*   In IGMETA, if LUN=999, the metafile is deactivated AND closed.
*   New routine IGMETN to set the metafile name. It is usefull for
*      some HIGZ version (ATCGKS, MSDOS ...)
*   Mods in IH routine to have the angle on the first coordinate with
*      Polar, Cylindrical and Spherical reprsentations.
*   Bug fixed in ntmgt: #include <stdio.h> was missing for SUN

*   In IGTEXT, XW,YW and WDTH are now initialized to 0.
*   Mods in various routines for DECGKS on VAX (Lynn Garren <GARREN@FNPSP>).
*   Now the number of colors in HILUT is 256.
*   New options POL, CYL, SPH, and PSD in IGTABL.
*   Sequences are now splited in hicdes, and QFTITLECH is used to set
*      the version number.
*   Logarithmic scales on X and Y axis are now available for Lego and Surface
*      plots. It implies mods in many routines around IGTABL and also
*      in IGAXIS: with options W and G the label were not correct.
*   The X11 mode to draw the cursor in ixreqlo is now "GXxor" which seems
*      to work in a better way than "GXinvert".
