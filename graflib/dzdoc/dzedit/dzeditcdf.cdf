that the number of data words is three for each bank. Their
contents indicates the documented number of data words and links.
Use option C to get colored display.

>ACTION DZEDSP
 
 
>COMMAND DZEQUIT
>GUIDANCE
Set flag to quit when returning from exec dzedit.kumac
>ACTION DZEQIT
 
>MENU MAKECODE
>GUIDANCE
Generate PATCHY KEEP sequences containing FORTRAN code. With option
'S' only the selected bank is treated, with option 'T' all banks
in the selected tree are treated. The KEEP sequences are named
with the hollerith Ids of the bank(trees) prefixed by mnemonics
like BOOK, LKOFF, DAOFF etc.
 
>COMMAND DATAOFFSETS
>GUIDANCE
Generate sequences of data word offsets for a selected bank (Option 'S')
or bank tree (Option 'T'). The names may optionally concatenated with
a max 8 character mnemonic like 'DO_'
With option 'Z' CHPFIX is appended, prefixed otherwise.
 
Option 'p' makes PARAMETER statements with offsets.
 
Option 'N' suppresses PARAMETER statements.
 
'2' allows to skip the first 2 char in data word name. (Allowed 1-9)
Option '='  (with '1')produces: IDATA4(I)=IQ(NOFF+4),
the sequence: '(I)=IQ(NOFF+' may be replaced by CHPFIX
 
Option 'C' produces COMMON/COBKID/...
 
Option 'H' produces CALL HBNAME(...
 
Example: a data word documented like this:
         *B.4 IDATA4     This is the 4th data word
         would produce (when putting CHPFIX to 'DO_':
         INTEGER DO_IDATA4
         PARAMETER (DO_IDATA4=4)

>ACTION DZEDOF
 
>COMMAND LINKOFFSETS
>GUIDANCE
Generate sequences of link offsets for a selected bank (Option 'S')
or tree (Option 'T').
Exactly two times 4 characters are needed to define bank and up-bank.
The variable generated is named CHPFIX concatenated with the
bank Id.
Example: if a link to bank IDBK is described like this:
         *B.LINK
         ...
         *B.7 IDBK  Bank containing anything
         would produce:
         INTEGER LOIDBK
         PARAMETER (LOIDBK=7)
>PARAMETERS

CHOPTL 'Option, S single bank' C D='T'
>ACTION DZELOF
 
>COMMAND LINKASSIGNMENT
>GUIDANCE
Generate sequences of link assignment statements for selected
bank (Option 'S') or tree (option 'T').
Exactly two times 4 characters are needed to define bank and up-bank.
The assumed linkoffset is named CHPFIX concatenated with the
bank Id.
Example: if a link to bank IDBK with Up-bank IDUP is described like:
         *B.UP IDUP
         *B.LINK
         ...
         *B.7  IDBK  Bank containing anything
         would produce:
         INTEGER LOIDBK
 
         LOIDBK=LQ(LOIDUP-7)

CHPFIX 'Prefix to BankId' C D='LO'
CHOPTL 'Option, S single bank' C D='T'
>ACTION DZELAS
 
>COMMAND BOOK
 
>GUIDANCE
Generate code to book a bank  (Option 'S') or bank tree (Option 'T').
With option 'B' (default) calls to MZBOOK are generated, with 'L'
calls to MZLIFT. For MZLIFT the bank parameters are put into arrays
MMIDBK which go into an own KEEP sequence.
The link to the bank 'BANK' is named LBANK, the uplink is assumed LUPBK,
if the up-bank is called UPBK.
For LBANK the declaration "INTEGER LBANK" is generated, for LUPBK it
is assumed to be done already. A call to MZFORM is generated if not
all data words are of the same type.
The link offset (JBIAS) is taken from the card *B.UP UPBK -JBIAS, if
JBIAS is given. If it is not given it is searched for in the
documentation of the Up-bank. If UPBK is "NONE" it is set to +1.
The following defaults are taken if the corresponding parameter is
not explicitly documented:
  IXDIV:  0 (i.e. div 2 in store 0)
  JBIAS:  no default
  NL:     0
  NS:     0
  ND:     0
  IOChar: no default, except if ND=0
  NZERO:  0

calls to MZBOOK. See also GUIDANCE for BOOK.
