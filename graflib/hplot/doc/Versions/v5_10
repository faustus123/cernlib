*
*       Mods in HPLF in order to plot the gaussian, exponential and
*          polynomial fits with the parameters of the curves.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/12   910605 11.45
*
*       Mods in HPLSWN in case of option 'S' in H/PLOT and ZONE.
*       New parameters XWID and YWID in HPLSET in order to change
*          the width of the X and Y axis tick marks.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/11   910503 17.51
*
*       The marker type is now reset in the example 2 (HPLEX2)
*       HPLCHA fill the COMMON QUEST in order to know if the picked
*          histo is in LOG scale or not.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/10   910321 10.56
*
*       Bug fixed in HPLAX2. In case of OPTION SOFT the font value
*          was not correct for the LEGO and SURFACE axis.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/09   910215 18.37
*
*       Changes of Patchy flags STRASB,NEWLIB,IBMMVS.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/08   910118 10.08
*
*       Bug fixed in HPLC: In case of OPTION LOGY on an histogram
*          with YMINI=YMAXI nothing was drawn.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/07   901220 14.13
*
*       The value of "all channels" can be printed if option STAT
*          is selected (and also SET STAT 1000000).
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/06   901207 11.31
*
*       Changes in HPLTAB : the color of the contour plots could
*          be changed via SET HCOL.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/05   901206 12.13
*
*       New option ERRX in HPLSET to define the error on X
*          in % of the bin width. The default is 0.5 . SET ERRX 0
*          set the default value. To delete the error on X one
*          should set ERRX to a small value. This implies mods
*          in HPLSET, HPLE, and HPLER. A new varialble RERRX is
*          in the COMMON HPL1.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/04   901130 11.17
*
*       It is now possible to give to HPLSET *SIZ, *TYP, *COL, *WID
*          and *FON to define respectivly all the text sizes, the
*          fill area type, the colors, the line width and the text
*          fonts with the same values.

*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/02   901123 10.56
*
*       Correction in HPLC in case of HMAX and LOGY
*
*::>          VERSION  5.10/00   901107 14.12
*
*       Axis are drawn after the 2D plots in HPLTAB
*       The drawing of the errors bars take care with HWID
*       Max for 2D histograms introduced in HPLTAB
*       SET STAT works now 2D histograms
*       New version of HPLTOC
*       New option 'B' in HPLFRA to avoid the Box drawing
*       New algorytms for LEGO and SURFACE
*       A 1 Dim histogram could be plotted as a LEGO
*       OPTION BAR and SET BARO and SET BARW work on LEGOS
