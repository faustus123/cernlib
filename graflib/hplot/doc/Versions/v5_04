*
*     30/07
*    - New option "SET HMAX" (HMAX is in percent and must be .LE. 1) which
*      allows the user to set the scale beetwen axis graduation and maximum of
*      histogram (default is 0.9). This option is particularly usefull when
*      superposition of several histograms.
*    - New options in HPLOT ("L", "K", "U", "+", etc...) because a Zebra bank
*      has been introduced (only if HPLH called), which memorised the
*      description of the histogram when option "L" ("Live") is selected
*      (usefull for future option "U" ("Update) ).
*
*     10/08
*    - new version of HPLC: new scale for histograms and functions with

*      Integer (resp. Real) for X or Y axis). If NDVX or NDVY have negative
*      value (in HPLSET) no optimisation is done for axis labelling.
*    - If TSIZ is set to 0 in HPLSET automatic calculation is performed for
*      character size of histogram title in order that it is not truncated.
*      (TSIZ 0 is taken by default).
*    - Correction in HPLEND.
*    - Bug correction in HPLSOF (coordinates in cm).
*    - Optimisation in order to have less CALL to ISELNT
*      (NTWIN=current transformation, NTHIST=histogram transformation
*      and 1=transformation cm).
*
*     07/10
*    - Option "L" is no more in use in HPLOT (option "K" replaces it). "K" is
