*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/20   24/10/94 10.49.41
*
*     HPLFUN is now completly dynamic: no limitation on the number
*        of points.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/19   21/10/94 11.05.01
*
*     Mods in HPLONE to redraw the axis tick marks if they have been
*        erased with an function drawn with option 'S' as a filled area.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/18   11/10/94 17.05.19
*
*     Bug fixed in HPLFIL: the string send to IGTCCH was too long.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/17   28/09/94 17.57.43
*
*     Bug fixed in HPLF: In case of LOG scale on Y, the
*        Y bank was filled at the wrong adress.
*     New option 'X' of IGZSET used in HPLOPT.
*     Bug fixed in HPLTAB. The LO3DPL flag is false in case of 1D
*        histos.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/16   26/08/94 17.04.51
*
*     Redesign of the ZEBRA data structure. All the banks
*        created by are linked on LHPLOT (see comments in HPLINT).
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/15   22/07/94 15.26.01
*
*     Bug fixed in HPLTAB. The decoding of option 'A' was misplaced
*        (conflict with option 'SCAT').
*     Small fix is HPLAER. After the call to HPLATT, the PLCI can
*       be equal to the color of the histogram border. It is now
*       reset to the histogram color (as before).
*     Mods in HPLF. NBINS is used instead of ICMAX to check if
*       the function to draw has too many points. This allows to plot
*       at least subranges.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/14   30/06/94 14.54.54
*
*     HPLTIT allows titles like:
*        'histo_title ; X_axis_title ; Y_axis_title ; Z_axis_title'
*     HPLAX allows to draw also the Z_axis_title. If CHYTIT contains
*        a ';' the Z title is drawn
*     The string CHTEMP is now in a sequence in order to save space.
*     Mods in HPLAXI and HPLONE to redraw the axis tick marks if
*        they have been erased with an histogram drawn with option 'S'
*        as a filled area.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/13   17/06/94 17.41.35
*
*     HPLAXI: IGXY is initialised to 0.
*     New options 'FB' and 'BB' in HPLTAB. The option 'A' to suppress
*        the axis drawing works also on 2D histograms.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/12   10/06/94 11.44.50
*
*     Fix in HPLNEW: the PTO was not done the first time.
*     New version of HPLH to plot histogram with several millions
*        of bins.
*     New routine HPLATT to set the HIGZ attributes from the HPLOT
*        attributes (histogram and Function). It avoids a lot of
*        duplicated code.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/11   01/03/94 09.10.55
*
*     In HPLOC, HPLCHA is called only if ISTAT > 0
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/10   21/02/94 11.16.33
*
*     Sometimes LCID was equal to 0 in HPLFIT and the number
*        of lines in the fit drawing was not correct.
*     Mods in HPLH and HPLRDW to use the new option 'Z' of IGHIST.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/09   14/02/94 17.38.52
*
*     New option 0 in HPLAER to avoid the automatic clipping
*        of markers.
*     In HPLAER the symbol clipping was applied only on histogram
*        drawing. Now it is also applied on vectors drawing.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/08   11/02/94 16.00.43
*
*     New FLAG WINNT in *HPLOT and *HPLEXAM.
*     Bug fixed in HPLAER: LBINS was not recomputed in
*        case of histograms with a non equidistant bining.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/07   17/01/94 17.59.01
*
*     Bug fixed in HPLTAB. the scale factor SCMAX should
*        be put in PAR2(5) only for 2-Dim histograms.
*     Bug fixed for the page numbering. In HPL1 the page
*        number variable was IOP which was often a local
*        variable. Now the page number is IOPAGE.
*     HPLPGN has been rewritten in a better way.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/06   07/01/94 18.39.43
*
*     Mods in HPLFR3 in order to use the new HIGZ 3D routines:
*        ISWN3 and ISVP3.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/05   15/12/93 19.28.57
*
*     Improvment in HPLTIT: If the histogram title contains a ';'
*        two titles are drawn: one horizontally and one vertically.
*     HPLONE has now a return error code. If it is 0 everything is
*        ok. If NOT, some problem occurs (i.e. log scale on Y=<0).
*        This error code is used in HPLOT.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/04   06/12/93 17.15.26
*
*     Bug fixed in HPLH. Side effect of: 5.14/07   920930 11.00
*     Fix in HPLH. With option U, the temporary bank HIST was
*        not updated. Side effect of 5.08/01   900503 14.48 (option +-)
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/03   01/12/93 17.10.36
*
*     New option HSTA (HNST) in HPLOPT.
*     If a parameter name given to the HBOOK routine HFINAM begin
*        with a '-', HPLFIT doesn't draw this parameter.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/02   16/11/93 17.40.56
*
*     Protection added in HPLCHA in case the histo IDH doesn't
*        exist.
*     Improvments in HPLH and HPLHUP: With the options +, -, +-
*        and U of HPLOT, the border is drawn only around the new
*        contribution not around each bin as before.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/01   08/11/93 09.47.24
*
*     The unsed parameter NCHR in HPLTX1 is suppressed.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.18/00   02/11/93 17.41.57
*
*     Unused sequence HPL2 removed in HPLTOC.
*     Bug fixed in HPLWN. An error message was printed even if
*        there was no error.
*     Bug fixed in HPLAER: The definition of the cm coordinates
*        (if requested) was done too late.
*     Bug fixed in HPLSET (SET 2SIZ was not corect).
