*::>          VERSION  5.17/12   22/10/93 11.24.18
*
*     Bug fixed in HPLF. The filled area was not good in of
*        histogram subrange drawing.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/11   12/10/93 16.39.20
*
*     Mods in HPLTAB to manage more than 1000 channels.
*     Improvment in HPLFRA: when the X1=X2 or Y1=Y2 the frame is
*        drawn with X1-1,X2+1,Y1-1,Y2+1.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/10   11/10/93 12.39.47
*
*     Optimization for alphanuneric labels removed in HPLAXI
*        (now done in IGAXIS).
*     Improvment in HPLCHA: If nothing is picked inside the picture
*        the HPLOT stucture, to retrieve the IDH, is used.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/09   01/10/93 10.53.26
*
*     Improvments in the error bars with edges marks drawing:
*        1) If the error bars are smaller than the KSIZ, the edges
*           marks are not drawn.
*        2) If the edges marks are bigger than the error bars,
*           the mimimum of the two is taken.
*     New options in HPLSET:
*        SMGR: define the Rigth Margin between the STAT/FIT boxes
*              and the histogram box (in % of the histogram box width).
*        SMGU: define the Up Margin between the STAT/FIT boxes and the
*              histogram box (in % of the histogram box heigh).
*        This implies mods in HPLSET, HPLSTA and HPLFIT.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/08   29/09/93 12.15.31
*
*     Statistics, Fit parameters, Date, File and additional tick
*        marks are now drawn in HPLTAB for 2D histograms. This
*        simplify PAW where duplicated code was added in PAPLOT
*        ans PAHIST and it makes these options working for commands
*        like CONTOUR.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/07   27/09/93 11.54.02
*
*     Change in HPLAER. The option E1 was not correct if the
*        marker type was "."
*     Two new routines:
*        HPLSEL do a CALL ISELNT and the NTWIN.
*        HPLWN  set the window parameters taking care with LOG scale.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/06   15/09/93 12.12.52
*
*     New routine HPLFR3 (frame 3d).
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/05   24/08/93 18.08.07
*
*     Bug fixed in HPLAER and HPLERR. The input vectors where
*        dimensionned with N, and N can be 0. Now they are dimensioned
*        with 1.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/04   24/08/93 15.45.13
*
*     The attributes are stored at the begininig of HPLFRA
*        and reset at the end (call to IZSAVA IZSETA).
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/03   930722 12.35
*
*     The HPLAER options are now called 0,1,2,3,4 to avoid
*        ambiguities when it is invoked from HPLOT.
*     New option W in HPLAER.
*     The routines HPLER and HPLE are now obsolete.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/02   930720 11.24
*

*
*     Bug fixed in HPLZON: if IW<=0 it is changed to 1.
*
*::>          VERSION  5.17/00   930705 12.40
*
*     Protection added in HPLFRA.
*     Improvments in HPLTAB to allows histograms with more
*        than 1000 bins.
*     New routine HPLAER to draw asymetric error bars.
